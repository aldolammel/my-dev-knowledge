PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS: SEMANTIC

    Semantics refers to the meaning and behavior of the code; what the code actually does when it runs.

        E.g. with Python:
            # Calculate average of two numbers!
                a = 10
                b = 20
                average = a + b / 2    # Right syntax, bad semantic! Shoulb be average = (a + b) / 2
                print(average)         # Output: 20.0 (should be 15.0)
