FORMATTER TOOL: WHAT IS IT

    Consistency & Readability!

    It checks the consistent code style and its visual presentation. So it automatically rewrites
    your code to adhere to a predefined set of stylistic rules. It operates purely on the syntax
    (the structure of the code) without understanding its semantics (the meaning of the code).

    >> Primary Purpose:
        To enforce a consistent code style and visual presentation.

    >> Output:
        Rewrites the code!

    >> Tool's rules examples:
        - Indentation (spaces vs. tabs, how many);
        - Line length (wrapping at 80/100/120 characters);
        - Use of quotes (single vs. double);
        - Adding/removing trailing commas;
        - Placement of braces and parentheses;
