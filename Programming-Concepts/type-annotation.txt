TYPE ANNOTATION:

    It's a programming feature that adds optional type hints to variables, function parameters, and
    function return values, clarifying their expected data types.

    Performance alert!
        It's too computationally expensive to check types on runtime, so if you are knocking up a
        quick script to do something once then it's unnecessary! But if you're working with
        multiples maintainers, it may avoid many issues.
