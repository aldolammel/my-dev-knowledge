PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS: SYNTAX

    Syntax refers to the grammar and structure of the code - the set of rules that define how to write valid code in a language.

        E.g. with Python:
            if x > 5:
                print("Hello")

        Correct syntax because:
            - Proper colon after condition;
            - Proper indentation;
            - Parentheses for function call.
