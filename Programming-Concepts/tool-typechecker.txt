TYPE-CHECKER TOOL: WHAT IS IT

    Correctness & Reliability!

    It analyzes your code to ensure you are not performing invalid operations, like adding a string 
    to a number or calling a method that doesn't exist on an object. This happens before the code
    runs (at compile time or during editing).

    >> Primary Purpose: 
        To verify that the values and data structures in your program are used in a consistent and
        valid way according to their defined types.

    >> Output:
        Reports errors (blocks execution)!

    >> Tool's rules examples:
        - Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number';
        - Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number';
        - Object is possibly 'null';
