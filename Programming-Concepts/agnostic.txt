PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS: AGNOSTIC

    In programming, "make your content agnostic" means designing your system so that content (data, UI components, text, media, etc.) is separated from the logic, presentation, and underlying technology that uses it.

    The goal is to ensure content can be reused, reformatted, and delivered to different platforms, devices, or interfaces without being tied to any specific one.
