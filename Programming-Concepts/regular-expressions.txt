PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS: REGULAR EXPRESSIONS (REGEX)


    As known as regex too, they are patterns used to match, search, and manipulate text based on specific rules. They're a powerful tool for string processing found in most programming languages.


    >> Core Concept:

        A regex is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.
        For example, \d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4} matches a pattern like "123-45-6789" (could be a social security number format).


    >> Common Use Cases:
        
        You'd use regex when you need to:
        - Validate input formats (emails, phone numbers, dates);
        - Search and replace text with complex patterns;
        - Extract specific data from strings;
        - Split strings based on patterns;
        - Clean or transform text data.

    
    >> Basic Building Blocks:

        - Literals: abc matches "abc" exactly;
        - Character classes: [0-9] matches any digit, [a-z] matches any lowercase letter;
        - Metacharacters: . (any character), ^ (start), $ (end), * (zero or more), + (one or more), ? (zero or one);
        - Quantifiers: {3} (exactly 3), {2,5} (between 2 and 5);
        - Escape: \ makes special characters literal, like \. matches a period.
