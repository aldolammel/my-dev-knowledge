PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS: PULL-REQUEST

    PR is a way to propose chancges to a codebase and request that someone review and "pull" those changes into the project. It's a fundamental part of collaborative development, especially when using version control systems like Git.


    Questions a good pull-request must to consider:

        1. WHY | Why is this change necessary?
            - They link to the Issue/Ticket.
            - They summarize the goal.

        2. HOW | How did you approach the solution?
            - A roadmap of the solution.
            - Justify non-obvious choices.

        3. RISK | What does this touch and what should we worry about?
            - Potential side effects.
            - Highlight tricy areas/features.

        4. PROOF | How do you know it works and won't break things?
            - Show test results.
            - Provide manual testing evidence.
            - Ensure automated checks are green.

        5. DONE | Is this truly done?
            - Did I updated the documentation?
            - Did I self-review and remove debug code/comments?
            - Did I leave helful comments for the next person?
