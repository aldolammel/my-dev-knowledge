LINTER TOOL: WHAT IS IT

    Code Quality & Bug Prevention!
    
    It performs static analysis on your code to find patterns that could lead to errors, security 
    vulnerabilities, or deviations from best practices. It understands semantics to a degree.

    >> Primary Purpose:
        To identify code smells, potential bugs, enforce coding conventions, and non-idiomatic
        patterns.

    >> Output:
        Reports warnings/errors (may auto-fix)!

    >> Tool's rules examples:
        - "Variables should be declared before use." (catches typos like myVar vs myvar)
        - "Unused variables should be removed."
        - "This function has a very high cognitive complexity."
        - "Avoid using == in JavaScript; use === instead."
        - "This if statement is always true."
