    The client–server model is a form of messaging pattern in a distributed app structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may be on the same device. 
    
    A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually doesn't share its computing resources, but it requests content or service from a server and may share its own content as part of the request. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests.

    Benefits:
        - All the data's stored on the servers, which generally have better security controls;
        - Since data storage is centralized, updates to that data are much easier to administer;
        - It works with multiple different clients of different specifications.

    Disadvantages:
        - Networks traffic blocking is one of the problems related to the client-server model;
        - If one server fail, clients’ requests cannot be served (except if P2P model);
