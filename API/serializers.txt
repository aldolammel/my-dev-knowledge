SERIALIZERS: WHAT IS IT

    They are components that convert complex data structures (like objects, dictionaries, or
    database records) into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed later. 
    The reverse process (converting serialized data back into its original form) is called
    deserialization.

        JSON ................ Web APIs, config files .................... json (Python), serde (Rust)

        Protocol Buffers .... High-performance binary serialization ..... protobuf (Google)
        YAML ................ Human-readable configs .................... PyYAML, ruamel.yaml
        MessagePack	......... Compact binary alternative to JSON ......... msgpack


    >> When to use:

        - When building APIs (e.g., REST/gRPC);
        - When saving/loading application state;
        - When communicating between different programming languages.


    >> Use cases:

        >> API Development
            (e.g., in Django REST Framework, FastAPI, or Flask)

            - Convert database models (e.g., Python objects) to JSON/XML for HTTP responses.
            - Parse incoming JSON/XML data into Python objects for processing.

            E.g.
                Django Rest Framework:
                    /Python/Web-development/django/component-libraries/django-rest-framework/


        >> Data Storage

            - Save objects to files (e.g., as JSON, YAML, or binary formats like Protocol Buffers).

            E.g.
                xxxxxxxxx
                    /xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


        >> Inter-Process Communication

            - Send data between services (e.g., microservices) over networks (often as JSON or binary).

            E.g.
                xxxxxxxxx
                    /xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
