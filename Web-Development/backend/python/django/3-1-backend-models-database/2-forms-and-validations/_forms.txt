FORMS (SUPER BASIC INSTRUCTION)

    >> For Django, forms are specific formularies used ONLY through front-end, and that
        not include CMS forms at all;

    >> If you want to build or improve a front-end form, keep in mind you must work with 
        files called 'forms.py' that can be created once into each sub-app folder;
    
    >> Everything for forms.py:
        /33-Web-development/backend/python/django/9-forms/

    >> Everything for forms present on the CMS (admin.py):
        /33-Web-development/backend/python/django/4-cms-admin/
