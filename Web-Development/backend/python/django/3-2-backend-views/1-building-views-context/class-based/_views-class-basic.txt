VIEWS CLASSES: USING BASIC INHERIT:

    >> With a basic view inherit, you are able to create your own view-class-based with all the
        potential offered by classes in views.py. You'll write more code!

    >> It handles the basic HTTP request methods (get, post, etc).

    >> Perfect when you need to implement custom logic for handling HTTP requests that don't fit
        the standard patterns provided by other CBVs.


    E.g.

        from django.views import View
        
        class MyOwnTestView(View):  # This 'View' in classname is a convention.
            def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                return HttpResponse("Hello, this is a GET request")
            def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                return HttpResponse("Hello, this is a POST request")
