TEMPLATES: CALLING A FORM

    >> All form that will be loaded in a template (front-end) comes from a forms.py file; 

    >> All form is called by a view (views.py) where the form template (html) is defined and
        the form-data itself is sent to forms.py file through a 'View Context' (dict);

    >> To custom a form with its fields, basically you'll work over the forms.py and 
        the template (.html) files;

    >> CALLING A FORM: BASIC
        >> Letting Django deal everything:

            {{ form }}                  <- It generates the entire form automatically.


    >> CALLING A FORM: PROFESSIONAL
        >> Let explore the Django power without loose customization:

            {{ form.first_name.label }}  <- It brings the field name!
            {{ form.first_name }}        <- This will create the input and its configs automatically!


            >> To customize the input created by Django, use forms.py associated with 'widgets':

                /33-Web-development/backend/python/django/9-forms/customizing-basic-attrs-connected-model.py


            >> Or to customize an extra field (not from connected model):

                /33-Web-development/backend/python/django/9-forms/customizing-basic-attrs-extra-field.py


    >> CALLING A FORM: YOU ARE WEIRDO!
    
        If you wanna literally create each input/select/checkbox by your own, reminder:
        Django is a chaos like this!
