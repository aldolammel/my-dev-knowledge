VUE.JS PROJECTS: SPA VS MPA

    A) Single-Page-Application (SPA);
        Each section/matter of the app belongs just one page, not demanding any kind of reload
        from the browser;

    B) Multi-Page-Application (MPA);
        Each section/matter of the app has its own page and URL, demanding the browser a reload
        for each page visited;
