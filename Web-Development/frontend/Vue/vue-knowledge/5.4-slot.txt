VUE.JS COMPONENTS: SLOT

    Slot is the Vue way to send HTML fragments (previously compiled) from the parent-component to
    its child/children.

    >> Slots allow you to create generic, flexible components that can be reused with different
        content while maintaining the same structure and styling.

    >> Slots separate the component's structure/logic from its content, making components more
        maintainable and allowing different devs to work on structure vs content independently.

    >> Parent components can inject any type of content (text, HTML, other components) into
        child components without modifying the child's internal structure.
