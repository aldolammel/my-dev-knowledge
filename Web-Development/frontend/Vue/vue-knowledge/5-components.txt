VUE COMPONENTS:


    >> A component in Vue.js is a reusable, self-contained piece of code that encapsulates HTML
        template, JavaScript logic, and CSS styling into a single unit. Think of it as a custom
        HTML element that you can use throughout your app.


    >> Each component is a sub-app (child) inside an app (parent);


    >> Parent can send data to its children, but children CANNOT send data to their parents.
        This concept is called One-way-data-flow, and it can be better managed by Props and Emits:

        /Web-Development/frontend/Vue/vue-knowledge/12-emits.txt

    
    >> A component can be global or local, depends how often it will be shown:
        /Web-Development/frontend/Vue/vue-knowledge/5-using-component-global-or-local.txt


    >> Convention: components' names must be written using PascalCase, it means no space or special
                    character, just first letter upper, and all first letters if it composed by two
                    or more words. 

                        E.g.
                            MyComp, UserContact, HeroHome, FaqSection, H2Title.

                        E.g. importing:
                            import MyComp from './components/MyComp.vue'

                        E.g. calling it:
                            <MyComp>...</MyComp>
                            <!-- or -->
                            <MyComp />
                    
                    
                    Alternatively: you can use kebap-case as well. A good example of component named
                                    with kebab-case:

                                        E.g.
                                            my-comp, user-contact, hero-home, faq-section, h2-title.
                                        
                                        E.g. importing:
                                            import my-comp from './components/my-comp.vue'

                                        E.g. calling it:
                                            <my-comp>...</my-comp>  <!-- it's NOT possible to close like using only '/>'.
