                - App.vue            ! the app itself. It's ran when you wanna see the app working.
                - main.js            ! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    >> A Vue.js app file (.vue) divide itself by 3 layers:
        1) Script
        2) Template
        3) Style

        Important basic knowledge about each one:


        >> <SCRIPT> layer:
            
            >> There are 2-ways to code components, using 'Options API' or 'Component API' but both
                use JavaScript (TypeScript is optional) to be written:

        >> <TEMPLATE> layer:

            >> Templates is basically pure HTML, and each template can be fragmented in infinite
                other small pieces, using Vue Component structure associated with Vue Slots:

        >> <STYLE> layer:

            >> Each component (.vue file, for example) can have its own <style> tag where all the
                style coded in there can be glogal (for the parent component and its child ones) or
                local so the style tag is restricted only to the component the style tag belongs.

                    <!-- if 'scoped', the style is only local for the current component -->
                    <style scoped>
                        ...
                    </style>
