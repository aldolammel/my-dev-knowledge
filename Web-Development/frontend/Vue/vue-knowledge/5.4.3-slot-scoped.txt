VUE.JS COMPONENTS: SCOPED SLOTS, THE WAY TO USE SLOTS WITH FOR-LOOPS

    >> Basic about slots:
        /Web-Development/frontend/Vue/vue-knowledge/5.4-slot.txt
    
    Slot content has access to the data scope of the parent-component, because it is defined in 
    the parent. Slot content DONT have access to the child-component's data. Expressions in Vue
    templates can only access the scope it's defined in, so it's correct to say:

        Slot content doesn't have access to state in the child-component!

    However, we can pass attributes to a slot outlet just like passing props to a component:

    >> Example:


        <!-- Parent component -->
        <CourseGoals #default="slotProps">
            <h2>{{ slotProps.arg1 }}</h2>
            <p>{{ slotProps.arg2 }}</p>
        </CourseGoals>


        <!-- Child component -->
        <li
            v-for="(goal, idx) in goals"
            :key="idx"
        >
            <slot
                name="default"
                :arg1="goal"
                arg2="xxxx"
            />
        </li>
