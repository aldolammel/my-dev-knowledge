VUE ROUTER: WHAT IS IT

    Vue Router is the official client-side routing solution for Vue. Client-side routing is used
    by single-page apps (SPAs) to tie the browser URL to the content seen by the user. As users
    navigate around the app, the URL updates accordingly, but the page doesn't need to be
    reloaded from the server.

        https://router.vuejs.org/

    Different URL's without browser reloading:

        E.g.
            https://domain.com/
            https://domain.com/about
            https://domain.com/products/biketrial
            etc


        E.g. of routers on app main menu:
            - Each menu link must be using the <RouterLink> tag (open and close the tag);
            - Define with <RouterView /> tag where the menu link's content (views) will be visualized;

            <!-- Navigation menu -->
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <RouterLink to="/">
                        Home (It's a View)
                    </RouterLink>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <RouterLink to="/about">
                        About (It's a View)
                    </RouterLink>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <RouterLink to="/contact">
                        Contact (It's a View)
                    </RouterLink>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Where each View is rendered when its RouterLink is clicked: -->
            <RouterView />
