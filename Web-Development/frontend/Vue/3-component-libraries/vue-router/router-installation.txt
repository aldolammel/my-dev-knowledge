VUE ROUTER: INSTALLATION AND INTEGRATION

    Aware: if you already created your project via Vue-CLI (default), you probably already have
                the Router once it was an Vue-CLI option during the project creation process.                
                Make sure about, in Vue project folder:
                    
                    $ npm list
                    
                    >> If you won't see any router stuff, keep with the installation and integration
                        processes below.


    1) Installing:
        
        # To install Vue-Router:
            $ npm install vue-router@<version you want>
        # Check installation:
            $ npm list

        >> Uninstall (if needed):
            /Web-Development/frontend/Vue/3-component-libraries/vue-router/router-uninstall.txt
            

    2) Integration:

        2.1) Create router config file (index.js) in /frontend/src/router/ folder!
            E.g.
                /Web-Development/frontend/Vue/3-component-libraries/vue-router/example/src/router/index.js

        2.2) Create your route components:
            E.g.
                /Web-Development/frontend/Vue/3-component-libraries/vue-router/example/views/HomeView.vue
                /Web-Development/frontend/Vue/3-component-libraries/vue-router/example/views/About.vue

        2.3) Configure router in main app via its JavaScript file in /frontend/src/ folder!
            E.g.
                /Web-Development/frontend/Vue/3-component-libraries/vue-router/example/src/main.js
            

        2.4) Add RouterView to Vue main app (e.g. App.vue):
            E.g.
                /Web-Development/frontend/Vue/3-component-libraries/vue-router/example/src/App.vue
