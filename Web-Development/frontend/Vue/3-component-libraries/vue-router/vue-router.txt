VUE ROUTER: WHAT IS IT

    Vue Router is the official client-side routing solution for Vue. Client-side routing is used
    by single-page apps (SPAs) to tie the browser URL to the content seen by the user. As users
    navigate around the app, the URL updates accordingly, but the page doesn't need to be
    reloaded from the server.

    Different URL's without browser reloading:

        E.g.
            https://domain.com/
            https://domain.com/about
            https://domain.com/products/biketrial
            etc


        E.g. of routers on application menu:
            - Each menu link must be using the <router-link> tag (open and close the tag).
            - Right after the nav menu, call the <router-view /> tag.

            <div id="nav">
                <ul>
                    <li><router-link to="/">A</router-link></li>
                    <li><router-link to="/b">B</router-link></li>
                    <li><router-link to="/c">C</router-link></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <router-view/>
