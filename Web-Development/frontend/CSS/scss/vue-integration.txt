SCSS/SASS: VUE INTEGRATION

    >> CSS Pre-processors using Vue.js + Vite:

        >> .scss/.sass (a Vite built-in solution):
            
            # Associating the Vite built-in solution to the project (only for dev environment):
                $ npm add -D sass-embedded
                    # Verify your SASS dependency in package.json in the root project-folder:
                        E.g.
                            {
                                "devDependencies": {
                                    "sass-embedded": "^1.89.1",
                                }
                            }
        
            # In all Vue components using CSS, include the language in Style tag:
                
                E.g.:
                    # .scss/.sass
                    <style lang="scss" scoped>
