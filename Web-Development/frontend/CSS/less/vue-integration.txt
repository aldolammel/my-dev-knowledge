LESS: VUE INTEGRATION

    >> CSS Pre-processors using Vue.js + Vite:

        >> .less (a Vite built-in solution):
            
            # Associating the Vite built-in solution to the project:
                $ npm add -D xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
                    # Verify your LESS dependency in package.json in the root project-folder:
                        E.g.
                            {
                                "devDependencies": {
                                    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
                                }
                            }
        
            # In all Vue components using CSS, include the language in Style tag:
                
                E.g.:
                    # .less
                    <style lang="XXXXXXXXXXXXX" scoped>
