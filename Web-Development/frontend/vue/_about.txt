VUE.JS: WHAT IS IT


    Vue.js (pronounced "view JS" or just "view") is a JavaScript framework that makes building
    interactive and reactive web front-ends. It's a progressive and open-source way to build
    client-side web apps.


        >> Vue uses the benefits of JavaScript available in the user browser to create actions and
            interations without to download HTML pages and more from a the server/host;


        >> With Vue, the developer doesn't need to recreate the wheel, nor to create a
            code-philosophy for each new project if they would use only raw JavaScript;


        >> Vue core library is focused on the view layer only. Advanced features required for
            complex apps such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via
            officially maintained supporting libraries and packages;


        >> Vue varnames and function names should respect the JS convention: to use camelCase.

            >> Widget way: you use Vue just for a small portion of your web app, where the most of
                            it is controled by server-side;
            
            >> Single-Page-Application (SPA): you use Vue to create/manage the entire web app,
                                                so the server-side only sends one HTML page to the
                                                client-side, and Vue takes over and controls the UI;
