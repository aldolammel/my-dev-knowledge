VUE: PROPS ("PROPERTIES")

    Props in Vue.js are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They create
    a one-way data flow where the parent sends data down to the child.

    The defineProps(), what Props do:

        - Allow parent components to pass data to child components;
        - Make components reusable by accepting different input values;
        - Create a communication channel from parent to child;
        - Are read-only in the child component (shouldn't be mutated directly);


    E.g.


        # Step 1 - Define what data (properties) this component wants to receive from
                    its parent (App.vue, for example):

            <!-- E.g. ChildComponent.vue -->
            <script setup>  // 'setup' only in case you're using 'Composition API' approach.

                // The parent app must send to this component an object of books:
                const { books } = defineProps({
                    books: {
                        type: Array,  // It's a good practice to type the variable!
                        required: true,
                    }
                });

            </script>
        

        # Step 2 - In the parent component, define which data (properties) will be sent for which
                    one of its children components:
            
            <!-- E.g. App.vue -->
            <script setup>  // 'setup' only in case you're using 'Composition API' approach.
                
                // Data:
                const dbBooks = [
                    // ...
                ];
                const dbDrinks = [
                    // ...
                ]

            </script>

            <template>
                <!-- Defining which child component will receive which data: -->
                <Books :books="dbBooks" />
            </template>


        # Step 3 - Back to the child component, apply the data properties received on the template:

            <!-- E.g. ChildComponent.vue -->
            <template v-if="!books.length">
              <p>No books yet.</p>
            </template>
            <template v-else>
                <div
                    v-for="book in books"
                    :key="book.isbn"
                    class="book"
                >
                    <img 
                        :src="book.cover"
                        :alt="book.title"
                    >
                    {{ book.title }}
                    {{ book.author }}
                    <button :class="{ isRead : book.isRead }">
                        <span>
                            {{ book.isRead ? 'Read!' : 'Not read yet' }}
                        </span>
                    </button>
                </div>
            </template>
