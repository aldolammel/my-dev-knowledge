CREATING A NEW COMPONENT (DEDICATED FILES):


    0) Basic about it:
        /Web-Development/frontend/vue/vue-knowledge/5-components.txt


    1) Make sure you got the folder:
        /vue_project_root/src/components/


    2) In /components/ create the component file:
        MyComponentName.vue

            # Its content:
            <script setup>  <!-- SETUP only in case you're using 'Composition API' approach -->
                // code...
            </script>

            <template>
                <div>
                    My New Component
                </div>
            </template>

            <!-- Not mandatory: -->
            <style>
            </style>


    3) Import the component in your App.vue:

        <script setup>  <!-- SETUP only in case you're using 'Composition API' approach -->
            import MyComponentName from './components/MyComponentName.vue';
            
            //...
        </script>


    4) If you need to call external data (from App.vue, for example), you must to use PROPS in
        your component file:
            /Web-Development/frontend/vue/vue-knowledge/11-props.txt
