DIRECTIVE: V-BIND


    >> It's accepted for: any (with arg), obj (without arg).

        >> You can apply v-bind using 'v-bind:' or just ':' before an attribute for example:

            >> Calling URL:
            
            <img :src="p.image" /> so its the same of <img src="https://somedomain.com/image.png" />
        

        >> Using v-bind to deactivate a button:

            <button
              :disabled="product.quantity <= 1"
              ...
            >
                Remove
            </button>

        
        >> Including a css-class dynamically:

            <div
                class="menu-link"
                :class="{ selected : product.active }"
            >

                # Output if menu-link is selected: 
                    class="menu-link selected"
