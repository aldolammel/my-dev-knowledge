COMPONENT APPROACH: 2-WAYS TO CODE A COMPONENT


    >> There are 2 ways to create Vue scripts, and them are called 'Options API'
        and 'Composition API':


        >> Options API:

            It's a way to define Vue components using an object with predefined option properties.
            The code is organized by options (data, methods, computed, etc.). It's the best way for
            Vue beginners.

            Conventions:
                - Component layers follow the order: template, script, style;

        >> Composition API:

            The modern script syntax that is more concise and recommended approach for Vue 3,
            bringing flexibility for mid and large projects. It's much more close to the JS;

                - The reactivity of template layer's elements need to be declared on script layer;
                - xxxxxx
                - xxxxxxxx

            Conventions:
                - Component layers follow the order: script, template, style;
                - ref() only for primitives, reactive() only for objects;
