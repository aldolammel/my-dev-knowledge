COMPONENT APPROACH: 2-WAYS TO CODE A COMPONENT


    >> There are 2 ways to create Vue scripts, and them are called 'Options API'
        and 'Composition API':


        >> OPTIONS API:

            It's a way to define Vue components using an object with predefined option properties.
            The code is organized by options (data, methods, computed, etc.). It's the best way for
            Vue beginners.

            Conventions:
                - Component layers follow the order: template, script, style;

            Examples:
                /Web-Development/frontend/vue/vue-knowledge/3-example1-using-options-api.vue
                /Web-Development/frontend/vue/vue-knowledge/3-example2-using-options-api.vue

        >> COMPOSITION API:

            The modern script syntax that is more concise and recommended approach for Vue 3,
            bringing flexibility for mid and large projects. It's much more close to the JS;

                - The reactivity of template layer's elements need to be declared on script layer;
                - xxxxxx
                - xxxxxxxx

            Conventions:
                - Component layers follow the order: script, template, style;
                - ref() only for primitives, reactive() only for objects;

            Examples:
                /Web-Development/frontend/vue/vue-knowledge/3-example1-using-composition-api.vue
                /Web-Development/frontend/vue/vue-knowledge/3-example2-using-composition-api.vue
