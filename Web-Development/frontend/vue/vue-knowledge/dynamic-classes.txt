DYNAMIC CSS CLASSES IN AN HTML FILE:

    >> If you want to add a new class in a html tag, you should use the 'v-bind directive':

        >> Example 1: you wanna see a div with another css class if the user to click over the div:
            
            Static html of a selected div:
                
                <div class="selected">

            Now, using dynamic class with v-bind:
                
                <div 
                    <!-- class attribute empty or not -->
                    class=""

                    <!-- If the 'active' is true, the div-class will get the 'selected' class too -->
                    :class="{ selected : product.active }"

                    <!-- If the div's clicked, the 'active' value is changed to its opposite value -->
                    @click="product.active = !product.active"
                >


            Another example, now using arg on the conditional:

                <div 
                    v-for="(product, idx) in products"
                    :key="idx"
                    class="product"
                    :class="{ inCart : isInCart(product) }"
                >

                PS: this 'inCart' is the css-style-class to be added if the conditional returns true.
