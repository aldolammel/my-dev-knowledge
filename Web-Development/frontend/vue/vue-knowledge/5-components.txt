VUE COMPONENTS:

    >> A component in Vue.js is a reusable, self-contained piece of code that encapsulates HTML
        template, JavaScript logic, and CSS styling into a single unit. Think of it as a custom
        HTML element that you can use throughout your app.

    >> Components are mini-apps inside an app;

    >> Convention: components' names must be written using kebab-case, it means to use 2 or more
                    names separated by dash. It avoids potential clashes with Vue or HTML built-in
                    element names. A good example of component named with kebab-case:

                        E.g.
                            user-contact, hero-home, faq-section, h2-title.
