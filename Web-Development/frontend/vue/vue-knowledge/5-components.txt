VUE COMPONENTS:

    >> A component in Vue.js is a reusable, self-contained piece of code that encapsulates HTML
        template, JavaScript logic, and CSS styling into a single unit. Think of it as a custom
        HTML element that you can use throughout your app.

    >> Components are mini-apps inside an app;

    >> Convention: components' names must be composed by 2 names separated by dash. It avoids
                    potential clashes with Vue or HTML built-in element names.
                    Good example of component names to use:

                        E.g.
                            user-contact, hero-home, faq-section, h2-title, etc.
