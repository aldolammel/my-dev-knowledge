COMPUTED PROPERTIES VS METHODS:


    Basically, both do the same, but:


        >> Computed Properties:

            - Better performance because they only are recalculated if their
                variables (dependencies too) are updated;


        >> Methods:
        
            - Each interation the methods are recalculated;
