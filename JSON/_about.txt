JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):

    JSON file is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write,
    and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is primarily used to transmit data between a
    server and a web application.

    IMPORTANT:
        Json always returns a dictionary.
