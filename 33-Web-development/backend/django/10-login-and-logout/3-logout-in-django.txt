    LOGOUT IN DJANGO:


    >> Make sure you already have these routes (urls.py):

        /33-Web-development/backend/django/10-login-and-logout/0-registering-by-frontend.txt

    
    >> You don't need to create additional routes specific for login or logout;
    

    >> It's mandatory to use the POST method to execute the logout through Django:
        
        
        <form action="{% url 'accounts:logout' %}" method="post">
            
            {% csrf_token %}

            <button type="submit">
                Log out
            </button>

        </form>
