    REMEMBERING THE USER LANGUAGE

        >> If user authenticaded, the user last language chosen is saved on the database;

        >> If an anonymous, let's create a cookie that will remember that visitor choice for X days;



        1) Make sure you are ready for next moves:

            /33-Web-development/backend/django/8-translate-and-internationalization/1-starting-translation.txt

        
        X) settings.py:

            LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME = 'user_language'
            LANGUAGE_COOKIE_AGE = 2592000  # 30 days.


        X) Create and register (in settings.py 'middlewares' list) middleware that checks if the
            user is logged in and retrieves the language from their profile, or checks the language 
            cookie for anonymous users:

                /33-Web-development/backend/django/7-middlewares-and-signals/middlewares/remembering-user-language.py
