This is the config-folder (or main-app-folder). Never set in here specialized sub-app files or 
files for limited areas through the application. The files here are crucial for the application
health and are regularly used through all sub-apps.

E.g. of /config-folder/ extra content:

    - constants.py
    - context_processors.py
    - language.py
