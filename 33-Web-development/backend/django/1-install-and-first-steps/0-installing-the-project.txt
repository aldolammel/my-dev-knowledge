INSTALLING DJANGO:

    0) If you are RE-installing Django, skip all of this, and following only this one:

        /33-Web-development/backend/django/1-install-and-first-steps/reinstall-new-django-copy.txt


    1) Create the project folder, and get it:

        $ mkdir <project_folder>
        $ cd <project_folder>


    2) Define the method to install Django:

        2A) Using UV package (recommended, more professional)!
        2B) Or using common method (pip).

        ..........................
    
        2A) Using UV package:
            If you want to use the UV package, follow this:
            /33-Web-development/backend/django/1-install-and-first-steps/1-install-with-uv-package.txt

        2B) Using common method (pip):

            2B.1) Create the virtual environment and active it:
                /03-Virtual-Environment/

            2B.2) (OPTIONAL) Make sure you got your .gitignore updated with Django, environment and other things!
                
            2B.3) Installation:

                >> The same for Ubuntu and Windows:

                    >> Update pip module:
                        /04-Basic-Modules/pip-upgrade.txt

                    >> Install Django:
                        $ pip install django

                    >> Check the current django installed:
                        $ python -m django --version

                    >> upgrade django if needed;
                        $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
                

                Only for VSCode:
                    # DjLint (html template formatter for django/jinja)
                    $ pip install -U djlint
                    
                    # Install the DjLint extension for VSCode.
                    # Install the Django (by Baptiste) extension for VSCode.
                    # In VSCode, In Html's, change the language mode to 'Django-Html'


            2B.4) Create the Django Project Structure:

                # make sure you're in project root folder and:
                $ django-admin startproject core .    <-- This dot's important!


            2B.5) Make sure you're in the same folder the 'manage.py' file, and then start the django
                for testing purposes:

                    $ python manage.py migrate
                    $ python manage.py runserver

                    http://localhost:8000/
                    or
                    http://127.0.0.1:8000/


    3) Through the Config-folder (e.g. "core"), open the settings.py file:
    
        3.1) Organize the settings.py header:

            # App Essential Settings:
            BASE_DIR = ...
            SECRET_KEY = ...
            DEBUG = ...
            ALLOWED_HOSTS = ...



        3.2) Prepare a Global Context with the Essentioal info about the app:
                /33-Web-development/backend/django/3-2-backend-views/1-building-views-context/global-context.txt
        

        3.3) Still in settings.py file, if you won't use the SQLite as database,
            keep in mind your 'SECRET KEY';


        3.4) Define your database:
            /33-Web-development/backend/django/3-1-backend-models-database/0-installing-and-adminUser/1-define-your-database/


    4) Set the environment variables and create your .env file:
        /33-Web-development/backend/django/1-install-and-first-steps/environment-variables-django.py



    5) Create the 'templates' folder in the project-folder (Don't mistake with the config-folder);

        E.g. Django Project Structure:

            >core (it's the 'main-app' / the root folder)
                >core (same name of the project, but it's the config-folder)
                    -settings.py (where you register each sub-app in use)
                    ...
                >sub-app1-folder
                    ...
                >sub-app2-folder
                    ...
                >sub-app3-folder
                    ...
                ...
                -manage.py


    6) Create your first sub-app in the project:

        6.1) Show to Django where will be each template folder in your sub-apps, going to the config-folder 'settings.py' file
            and editing this line in 'template' list:
                From:
                    'DIRS': [],
                To:
                    'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'],

        6.2) Do this: /33-Web-development/backend/django/2-creating-and-deleting-apps/creating.txt


    7) Creating the admin user:
        $ python manage.py createsuperuser
        # Now, try to login, making sure the main-app is running:
        $ python manage.py runserver
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/



    8) Will this project have more than one language?

            If not, add in your settings.py:
                USE_I18N = False
                
            Otherwise:
                /33-Web-development/backend/django/8-translate-and-internationalization/starting-translation.txt
    

    9) Optionals:

        9.1) Will you use file upload?
            /33-Web-development/backend/django/5-uploads/files/

        9.2) Will you use imagem upload?
            /33-Web-development/backend/django/5-uploads/images/
