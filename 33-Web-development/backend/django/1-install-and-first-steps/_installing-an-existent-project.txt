INSTALLING AN EXISTENT DJANGO PROJECT:


    1) Create the project folder, and get it:
        $ mkdir <project_folder>
        $ cd <project_folder>

        
        1.1) Clone the project repository;

            $ git clone HTTPS_OF_PROJECT .    // that "." makes the clone to be installed exactly in the folder where you are, dont creating the parent folder.
            $ git status                      // everything must be fine.

        1.2) Be sure you are in the right branch to work! Are you sure you should use MASTER branch?
            The last version of the project is the MASTER branch?

            /35-version/git/


    2) Create the virtual environment and activate it:
        /03-Virtual-Environment/


    3) Installation:

        The same for Ubuntu and Windows:

            >> Update pip module:
                
                $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

            >> Install Django:

                $ pip install django

            >> Check the current django installed:

                $ python -m django --version

            >> upgrade django if needed;

                $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        

        Only for VSCode:
            # DjLint (html template formatter for django/jinja)
            $ pip install -U djlint
            
            # Install the DjLint extension for VSCode.
            # Install the Django (by Baptiste) extension for VSCode.
            # In VSCode, In Html's, change the language mode to 'Django-Html'


    4) Install all custom modules required by the project;


    5) Set the right database and the project environment variables:
        /33-Web-development/backend/django/3-1-backend-models-database/0-installing-and-adminUser/1-define-your-database/
        /33-Web-development/backend/django/1-install-and-first-steps/environment-variables-django.py

    6) is there an Admin user for you?
    
        >> You didn't need to create a db a few minutes ago:
        
            >> There's an admin user, so use that!
            
            >> if there's no admin yet:
            $ python manage.py createsuperuser

        >> You needed to create a new db a few minutes ago:
        
            # Build up the database schema:
            $ python manage.py migrate
            
            # Create the admin to you:
            $ python manage.py createsuperuser


    7) If the application is using more than one language:

        >> Using Gettext/Rosetta/Parler:
            
            # Once the .po files already exists, this will compile them for this new application copy:        
            $ django-admin compilemessages
        

    8) Run an application:
        $ python manage.py runserver
