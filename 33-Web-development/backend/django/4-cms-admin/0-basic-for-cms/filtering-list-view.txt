FILTERING IN THE LIST-VIEW:

    >> If you want to create some filters in a specific list-view in the CMS,
        go to the admin.py and:

            class MovieCMS(admin.ModelAdmin):
                list_filter = ('year_movie',)


            # It will create a new column in list-view where you see
            # all years available in the database, also showing a
            # counter of entries/movies exist on each year.
