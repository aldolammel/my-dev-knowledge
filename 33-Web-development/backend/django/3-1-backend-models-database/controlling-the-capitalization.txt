CONTROLLING THE CAPITALIZATION:


    >> If you want to force each string entry to be lowercase or other format,
        you need to override the Django save() method on each class you want
        to customize how django will save the data on the database:

            class Movie(models.Model):
                name = ...
                
                def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    # Forcing the name to be lowercase on db:
                    self.name = self.name.lower()  
                    super().save(*args, **kwargs)


    >> But if you want to make it capitalized on the CMS list views, do it:

        xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


    >> If you want to make it capitalized on the front-end, use CSS!
