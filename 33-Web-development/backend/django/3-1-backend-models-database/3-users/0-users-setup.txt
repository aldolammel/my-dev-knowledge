USERS SETUP

    >> If your project needs any kind of user management, you must use these settings!
    
    >> They are Django built-in features, so do not re-create them and try don't change much! 


    1) Create a sub-app called 'accounts' and add it in the config-folder settings.py
        file as 'accounts' in 'Installed Apps' list;
