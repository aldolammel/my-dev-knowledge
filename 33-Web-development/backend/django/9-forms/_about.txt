DJANGO FORMS:

    >> If you're developing a web application that accepts user input from the front-end, 
        you'll need to understand and use forms (forms.py). Django provides a variety of 
        tools and libraries to help you build forms to accept input from site visitors and then 
        process and respond to the input.
        
        That said: a forms.py file by itself DOESN'T input anything into the database.
                    If a Form class apparently is inputting data, it's because that
                    Form class is linked with some models.py class or received data
                    from a views.py file.


                    >> Receiving data from Model:

                        /33-Web-development/backend/django/9-forms/form-receiving-data.py


                    >> Receiving data from View:

                        /33-Web-development/backend/django/9-forms/form-receiving-data.py

    
    >> The forms.py file is always manually created by the developer into some sub-app folder.
        You can create one for each sub-app folders that depend of forms.


    >> Imagine you got in the models.py file a class to record movies with a few fields to
        fill, and these fields must be filled by website visitors. As the models.py file is
        responsable to design our database, its tables and columns, the forms.py file is the 
        place to set the form that should be used by the visitors in order to include new
        movies in the database.
    
    
    >> There are two ways to build up a front-end form:
    
        1) Connecting a Model-class (models.py) to a Form-class (forms.py), making the
            Form-class inherit  the 'forms.ModelForm':

                /33-Web-development/backend/django/9-forms/class-based/inherit-ModelForm/forms.py


        2) Or creating a custom Form-class (forms.py), that inherit its features from 'forms.Form', 
            that doesn't impact the db and is NOT the best method to do forms if you consider the 
            'Movies' example mention before:

            /33-Web-development/backend/django/9-forms/class-based/inherit-Form/forms.py


    CMS FORMS:

        >> forms.py never be responsable for CMS forms. The forms specifically to CMS use
            'admin.py' file:

                /33-Web-development/backend/django/4-cms-admin/
