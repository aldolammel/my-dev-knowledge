VUEX: COMPUTED PROPERTIES

    While computed properties aren't a Vuex feature, they're commonly used with Vuex to
    access store state in a reactive way:

        >> Using computed properties to access Vuex Store:

            // In a Vue component file:
            export default {
                // Computed Properties:
                computed: {
                    // Accessing Vuex state through computed property
                    currentUser() {
                        return this.$store.state.user.currentUser;
                    },
                    
                    // Accessing Vuex getters through computed property
                    isLoggedIn() {
                        return this.$store.getters.isAuthenticated;
                    }
                },
                // Lifecycle hooks:
                // ...
            }
