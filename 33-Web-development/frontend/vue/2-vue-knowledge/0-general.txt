VUE.JS KNOWLEDGE

    >> What is Vue.js:
        /33-Web-development/frontend/vue/_about.txt

    >> Two main vue-cores:
        
        1) Declarative Rendering:
            Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.

        2) Reactivity:
            Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM (Document Object Model) when changes happen.

    
    >> Vue.js is splitted in 3 layers:
        
        1) Script: 
            Where the Vue.js methods and other functions stuff is set.
                In a .vue file, it is represented by a <script> tag.

        2) Template:
            Where the user interacts with the web application.
                In a .vue file, it is represented by a <template> tag.

        3) Style:
            Where CSS classes used by Vue.js will be stored.
                In a .vue file, it is represented by a <style> tag.
    

    >> Vue logic structure:

    >> With Vue.js, part of the work is done in JavaScript file, and another part
        in the HTML file.


    >> To create a Vue.js project, you will need a Build-Tool. Here is some options:

    >> DECLARATIVE RENDERING
        It's the same as 'Template variable' in Django Templates.
        You can use this only in HTML elements/tags, but never in their attributes (more about it,
        next).

            E.g. 

                {{ my_template_var }}


        >> DECLARATIVE RENDERING FOR DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTES
            If you need to use a Directive (more about it, next) in a HTML attribute, you cannot use
            Declarative Rendering {{ }} but ":" as sufix of the attribute name. Like this example:

                >> context:
                    You're using a for-loop that wanna call an image from db.
                    Each product has an 'image' attribute with the string value:
                        "/img/<nameImage.fileType>"

                    <div v-for="p in products">
                        <img src="/img/anyimage.gif">
                    </div>
                
                >> from this:
                    <img src="/img/anyimage.gif">
                
                >> to this:
                    wrong:
                        <img src={{ p.image }}>
                        <img src="{{ p.image }}">
                    right (using v-bind abbreviation ":" before html-tag's attribute):
                        <img :src="p.image">
