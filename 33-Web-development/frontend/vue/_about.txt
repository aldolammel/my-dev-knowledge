VUE.JS: WHAT IS IT

    Vue.js (pronounced "view JS") is a progressive and open-source model–view–viewmodel
    front-end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page apps.

    >> Vue.js is primarily a client-side JavaScript framework. It runs in the browser
        (front-end) and is used to build dynamic, reactive user interfaces.

    >> Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative 
        rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer 
        only. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state 
        management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting 
        libraries and packages.

    >> Once Vue.js is a JavaScript framework, Vue varnames and function names should respect
        the JS convention: to use camelCase.
