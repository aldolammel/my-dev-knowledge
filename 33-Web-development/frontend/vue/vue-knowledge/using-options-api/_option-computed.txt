OPTIONS API: COMPUTED PROPERTIES

    >> They are functions that return a value based on other reactive data. They're defined in the
    computed section of a Vue component and are accessed like regular data properties in
    the template.
    
    >> They are part of Vue's reactivity system and are available in every Vue component by default.

    E.g.
        # In a vue component file:
        <script>
        export default {
            data() {
                return {
                    firstName: 'Aldo',
                    lastName: 'Lammel'
                }
            },
            computed: {
                fullName() {
                    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
                }
            }
        }
        </script>
