URL ROUTERS:

    
    >> The router is a library that enables client-side routing for single-page apps (SPAs).
        It allows you to create multi-page navigation experiences without actually reloading
        the browser page.

        Different URL's without browser reloading:

            E.g.
                https://domain.com/
                https://domain.com/about
                https://domain.com/products/biketrial
                etc

    
    >> To use routers, install the Vue.js library for that:
