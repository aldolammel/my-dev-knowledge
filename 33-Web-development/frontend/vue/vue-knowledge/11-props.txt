VUE: PROPS

    Props in Vue.js are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They create a one-way data flow where the parent sends data down to the child.

    What Props Do:

    - Allow parent components to pass data to child components;
    - Make components reusable by accepting different input values;
    - Create a communication channel from parent to child;
    - Are read-only in the child component (shouldn't be mutated directly);
