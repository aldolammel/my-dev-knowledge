COMPOSITION API: COMPUTED PROPERTIES

    >> They are functions that return a value based on other reactive data. They're defined in the
    computed section of a Vue component and are accessed like regular data properties in
    the template.
    
    >> They are part of Vue's reactivity system and are available in every Vue component by default.

    E.g.
        # In a vue component file:
        <script setup>
        import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

        const firstName = ref('Aldo')
        const lastName = ref('Lammel')

        const fullName = computed(() => {
        return firstName.value + ' ' + lastName.value
        })
        </script>
