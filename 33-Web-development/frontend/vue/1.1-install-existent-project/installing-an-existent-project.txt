    >> On terminal, go to the vue-project-folder;

    >> Once there, check the package.json exists;

        >> What is build-tool?
            /33-Web-development/frontend/vue/2-vue-knowledge/1-build-tools.txt
    
        >> If you don't agree:
            # Use your favorite build-tool and install all dependencies manually.

        
        >> Or, if you agree:

            >> Ask to NPM install all dependencies:
                $ npm i
