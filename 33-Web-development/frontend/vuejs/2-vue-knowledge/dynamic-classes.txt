DYNAMIC CSS CLASSES IN AN HTML FILE:

    >> If you want to add a new class in a html tag, you should use the 'v-bind directive':

        >> Example 1: you wanna see a div with another css class if the user to click over the div:
            
            Static html of a selected div:
                
                <div class="selected">

            Now, using dynamic class with v-bind:
                
                <div 
                    <!-- class attribute empty or not -->
                    class=""

                    <!-- If the div's clicked, the 'active' value is changed to its opposite value -->
                    @click="product.active = !product.active"
                    
                    <!-- If the 'active' is true, the div-class will get the 'selected' class too -->
                    :class="{ selected : product.active }"
                >
