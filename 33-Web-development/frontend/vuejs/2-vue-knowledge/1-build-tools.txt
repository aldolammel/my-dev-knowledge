BUILT-TOOLS FOR VUE.JS:

    
    >> Vite (New standard, faster, modern, same creator of Vue.js)

        - It's NOT a framework, but a CLI (command line interface);
        - Since 2024, Vue.js is replacing Vue-CLI by Vite;


    >> Vue-CLI (Old standard)

        - It uses Webpack under the hood (slower);
        - 2025, it still works but no longer recommended for new projects;


    >> Nuxt.js (for SSR/SSG)

        - Uses Vite (or webpack) depending on configuration.
        - A meta-framework for Vue with built-in routing, state management, and SSR.
