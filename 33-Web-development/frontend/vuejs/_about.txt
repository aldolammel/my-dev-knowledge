    VUE.JS:

        Vue.js (pronounced "view JS") is a progressive and open-source model–view–viewmodel
        front-end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

        >> Vue.js is primarily a client-side JavaScript framework. It runs in the browser
            (front-end) and is used to build dynamic, reactive user interfaces.

        >> Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative 
            rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer 
            only. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state 
            management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting 
            libraries and packages.

        >> Once Vue.js is a JavaScript framework, Vue varnames and function names should respect
            the JS convention: to use camelCase.
