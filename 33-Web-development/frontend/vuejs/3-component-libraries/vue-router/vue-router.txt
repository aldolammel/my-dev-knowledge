    >> Vue Router is the official client-side routing solution for Vue. Client-side routing is used
        by single-page apps (SPAs) to tie the browser URL to the content seen by the user. As users
        navigate around the app, the URL updates accordingly, but the page doesn't need to be
        reloaded from the server.
