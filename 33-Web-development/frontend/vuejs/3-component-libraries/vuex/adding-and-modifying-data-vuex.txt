VUEX: HOW TO ADD/MODIFY DATA

    >> Basic: 
        
        >> all front-end data is stored in /projectroot/store/;
        
        >> VueX config-file is in /store/index.js;
        
        >> In config-file, the "state" dictionary means data, so it's all data being sent to
            the template/front-end.

                E.g.
                    state: {
                        products: [1, 2, 3];
                    }
        
        >> If a component needs data, it must be provided by state properties;

        

        >> To change a state/data property, Vuex demands you to create an "action" first to 
            request a change in the state. After that and finally, it will make the change be shown
            at the view (Vue components). This is the concept of one-way data flow.

                    In other words, you cannot make a state change directly from .vue file.
                    You must use the VueX config-file to do that: /store/index.js.

        >> If you are coding .vue files using "Options API" approach, be aware:
            Store data never must be used through the component "data", but component "computed";
