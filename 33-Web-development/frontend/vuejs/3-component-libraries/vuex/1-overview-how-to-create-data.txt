VUEX: HOW TO CREATE DATA

    0) Just look the VueX flow:
        /33-Web-development/frontend/vuejs/3-component-libraries/vuex/one-way-data-flow.png


    1) Declare the state property in /store/index.js (front-end's database of the Vue.js):

        E.g.
            state: {
                products = [],
            },


    2) Still in /store/index.js, create an action to request/take the data:

        2.1A) Data comes from an JSON:
            
            >> Using FetchAPI (native of JavaScript):
                /33-Web-development/frontend/javascript/examples/fetch-api-on-vuejs/vuex_action_using_fetchApi.js

            >> Using Axios:
                /xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

        2.1B) Data is local:
            xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    
    
    3) Each Vue component (view) that need data (or part of it) must despatch an action (previsouly
        created) through some lifecycle-hook, just like the 'created' one.
        Then in a component or in the app .vue file (recommended):

        E.g.
            export default {
                // Lifecycle hook:
                created() {
                    this.$store.dispatch('loadProducts');
                }
            }

            >> More about Lifecycle-hooks:
                /33-Web-development/frontend/vuejs/2-vue-knowledge/lifecycle-hooks.txt


    4) Let's create the mutation that will execute the action over a state. In other words, let's
        add/update a specific data/state:

        E.g.
            mutations: {
                setProducts(state, products) {
                    state.products = products;
                }
            },

            >> Crucial: make sure your action (in /store/index.js) is calling this mutation function!


    5) Checking whether the data is been sent to the browser, using the "Vue DevTool";
        - Open the Browser Develop Tool;
        - Go to the Vue tab;
        - Click over the component where the data is;
        - If everything's fine, you're seeing the 'computed' data somewhere on the dev panel;


    X) Create the link/button that will execute the action to add/update (mutation) an data;
        xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
