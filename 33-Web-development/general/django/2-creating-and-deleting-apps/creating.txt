CREATING DJANGO PACKAGES OF FUNCTIONS (APPS):

    Basic to know:
        >> file 'models.py' = this file represents through classes each table to be created for a specific app (package) of your main application/project;
        >> command 'makemigrations' = it's responsible for creating new migrations based on the changes you have made to your models;
        >> command 'migrate' = it's responsible for applying and unapplying migrations.


    1) Working with models.py (custom db tables):
        
        # Ask to Django convert the objects in models to db instructions:
        $ python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>
        
        # Now, check your app migrations folder to see if the instructions are okay.
        
        # Next, if you gave a green light, ask Django to execute the instructions:
        $ python manage.py migrate
