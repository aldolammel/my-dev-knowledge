DELETING DJANGO PACKAGE OF FUNCTIONS (APPS):


    >> If sub-app is NOT installed yet:

        1) Just delete the sub-app folder;


    >> If sub-app is running/installed:

        1) Basicaly, in the sub-app folder, delete all classes/tables from its 'models.py';

        2) Make the same in 'admin.py' when needed. If other file is calling that classes, 
            make sure to delete that calls too, including in other sub-apps if needed too;

        3) Update your database with these changes:
            # for all apps:
            $ python manage.py makemigrations
            # Or for a specific one:
            $ python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>

        4) Run the product and check if everything is okay:
            $ python manage.py runserver

        5) If everything is fine, apply the migration:
            $ python manage.py migrate

        6) In project folder, remove the sub-app path from the 'urls.py' file;

        7) Still in project folder, remove the sub-app name from the 'settings.py' file;

        8) Test the main-app again!
