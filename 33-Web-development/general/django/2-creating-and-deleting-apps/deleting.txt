DELETING DJANGO PACKAGE OF FUNCTIONS (APPS):

    1) Basicaly, in the folder app, delete all classes/tables from its 'models.py';

    2) Make the same in 'admin.py' when needed. If other file is calling that classes, make sure to delete that calls too, including in other apps if it happened;

    3) Update your database with these changes:
        $ python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>

    4) Run the product and check if everything is okay:
        $ python manage.py runserver

    5) If everything is fine, apply the migration:
        $ python manage.py migrate

    6) Remove the app path from the project 'urls.py'!

    7) Remove the app name from the project 'settings.py'!

    8) Test the application/project again!
