PROTECTING VIEW: AGAINST AUTHENTICATED USERS


    >> In some views.py file, include the importation and, after that, add the validation in
        the specific view that must not be available for authenticated users:

        E.g. 
        
            from django.shortcuts import redirect

            # If the user is already authenticated:
            if request.user.is_authenticated:
                return redirect('<subapp_namespace>:<name_view>')
