DJANGO STRUCTURE: VIEWS.PY


    >> Django is divided in 3 main parts: models, views, and templates.

    >> Views are responsable for manage what data will be send to user. The 'views.py' file contains
        all logic the user can see and which template/webpage the data will be seen. 
        
    >> The 'views.py' file is closely related with 'urls.py' file, this one defining which view will
        be called in certain URL;
    
    >> Through 'views.py' file you:

            - Handle user input and interact with models to retrieve data;
            - Render templates with the data obtained from models;
            - Return HTTP responses (like HTML, JSON, XML, etc).
