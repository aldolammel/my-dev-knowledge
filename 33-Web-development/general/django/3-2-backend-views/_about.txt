DJANGO STRUCTURE: VIEWS.PY


    >> Django is divided in 3 main parts: models, views, and templates.

    >> Views are responsable for manage what data will be send to user. Views.py contains all
        logic the user can see and which template/page the data will be seen. Through views.py you:

        - Handle user input and interact with models to retrieve data;
        - Render templates with the data obtained from models;
        - Return HTTP responses (like HTML, JSON, XML, etc).
