VIEWS CLASSES: USING PRESETS INHERIT:

    >> With a preset view, you can take benefits of other most used views through class ihenrit;

    >> To use a preset view, you must understand what's the purpose of the class you're creating:
                
        E.g.

            # A view for LIST products page:
            from django.views.generic import ListView

            class ProductsListView(ListView):  # This 'View' in classname is a convention.
                pass

            # A view for a product DETAIL page:
            from django.views.generic import DetailView
            
            class ProductDetailView(DetailView):  # This 'View' in classname is a convention.
                pass


    >> Django Documentation brings a lot of built-in methods that each of generic views bring
        within to be used:
