VIEWS CLASSES: USING PRESETS INHERIT:

    >> With a preset view, you can take benefits of other most used views through class ihenrit;

    >> Much less code lines;

    >> To use a preset view, you must understand what's the purpose of the class you're creating:
                

        >> A list page e.g.


            # If the view is TO LIST products on the page:
            from django.views.generic import ListView

            class ProductsListView(ListView):  # This 'View' in classname is a convention.
                template_name = 'products/list.html'
                model = Product
                context_object_name = 'products'


        >> A detail page e.g.

            # If the view is TO DETAIL a product on the page:
            from django.views.generic import DetailView
            
            class ProductDetailView(DetailView):  # This 'View' in classname is a convention.
                template_name = 'products/detail.html'
                model = Product

                # For specific DetailView usage, in urls.py always using in path() method the 'pk'
                # or 'slug', avoiding 'id'.


    >> Django Documentation brings a lot of built-in methods that each of generic views bring
        within to be used:
