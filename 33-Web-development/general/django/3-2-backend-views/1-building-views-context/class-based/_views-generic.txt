USING GENERIC VIEWS:

    >> With a generic view, you don't need to create a view for commom things like list-views and
        detail-views.

    >> To use a gerecic view, you must inherit the generic class that meet the purpose of 
        the class you are creating:
            
            E.g.

                # A view for LIST products:
                from django.views.generic import ListView
                class ProductsList(ListView):
                    pass

                # A view for a product DETAIL:
                from django.views.generic import DetailView
                class ProductDetail(DetailView):
                    pass


    >> Django Documentation brings a lot of built-in methods that each of generic views bring
        within to be used:
