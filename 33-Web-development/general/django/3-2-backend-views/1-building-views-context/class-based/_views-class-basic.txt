VIEWS CLASSES: USING BASIC INHERIT:

    >> With a basic view inherit, you are able to create your own view-class-based with all the
        potential offered by classes in views.py writing a little bit more code lines.
        
        E.g.

            from django.views import View
            
            class MyOwnTestView(View):  # This 'View' in classname is a convention.
                pass
