BUILDING THE CONTEXT:


    >> Context is the package of data the back-end sends to the front-end through sub-app views.py
        files.


    >> Something from the database is visible in a template (html) because this data is accessible
        in the dictionary called 'context' (convention!).

        views.py e.g.

            <code of query_sets> ...

            context = {
                'recipes': recipes,  # In the template (index.html), it'll be called as {{ recipes }}.
                'restaurants': restaurants,
            }

            return render(request, "recipes/index.html", context)
