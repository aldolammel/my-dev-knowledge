VIEWS REQUIRING LOGIN AUTHENTICATED:

    >> In each sub-app that you want to protect with login, open its 'views.py' and do this.
        Apply the decorator 'login_required' right before each protected function-based view:

        E.g.

            from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

            @login_required
            def blablabla(request):
                pass
