INSTALLING DJANGO:


1) Create the project folder, and get it:
    $ mkdir <project_folder>
    $ cd <project_folder>


2) Create the virtual environment and active it:
    <Check the folder '03-Virtual-Environment'>


3) Update the pip:
    <Check the folder '04-Basic-Modules'>


4) Installation:
    $ pip install django

    Only for VSCode:
    # DjLint (html template formatter for django/jinja)
    $ pip install -U djlint
    # Install the DjLint extension.
    # Install the Django (by Baptiste) extension.
    # In Html's, change the language mode to 'Django-Html'

5) Create the Django Project Structure:
    # make sure you're in project root folder and:
    $ django-admin startproject proj_<project_name> .


6) Make sure you're in the same folder the 'manage.py' file, and then start the django for testing purposes:
    $ python manage.py runserver


7) In root of the project, create each app of your project:
    $ python manage.py startapp <app_name>

    7.X) Create these folders into each app folder created:
        /app_folder/templates/
        /app_folder/templates/<app_name>/

    7.X) Show to Django where is each template folder in your apps, going to the project 'settings.py' and editing this line
        in 'template' list:
        from:
            'dirs': [],
        To:
            'dirs': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'],

    7.X) Create the urls.py file into each app created, adding the urlpatterns list in each file;
        from django.urls import path
        from . import views
        urlpatters = [path('', views.index)]

    7.X) Through the views.py into each app created, add a function with each pattern created in the app urlpatterns;
        from django.http import HttpResponse
        def index():
            return HttpResponse('Hello world')

    7.X) Go to your main project app (often the same name of the project) and open its urls.py file and include
        each app url references right after the admin line:
        from django.urls import path, include
        path("<app_name>/", include("<app_name>.urls"))

    7.X) Still in main project app, go to 'settings.py' file and add each app name in the 'INSTALLED_APPS' list.
        '<app_name>',
        '<app_name>',

8) Let's perform the database basic tasks:
        # It creates the database with basic tables:
        $ python manage.py migrate

    8.1) Creating the admin user:
        $ python manage.py createsuperuser
        # Now, try to login, making sure the application is running:
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

9) Test your app, running it:
    $ python manage.py runserver
