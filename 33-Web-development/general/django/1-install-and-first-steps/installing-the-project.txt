INSTALLING DJANGO:


    1) Create the project folder, and get it:

        $ mkdir <project_folder>
        $ cd <project_folder>


    2) Create the virtual environment and active it:

        /03-Virtual-Environment/


    3) Update the pip:

        /04-Basic-Modules/


    4) Installation:

        $ pip install django

        Only for VSCode:
            # DjLint (html template formatter for django/jinja)
            $ pip install -U djlint
            
            # Install the DjLint extension for VSCode.
            # Install the Django (by Baptiste) extension for VSCode.
            # In VSCode, In Html's, change the language mode to 'Django-Html'


    5) Create the Django Project Structure:

        # make sure you're in project root folder and:
        $ django-admin startproject proj_<project_name> .


    6) Make sure you're in the same folder the 'manage.py' file, and then start the django
        for testing purposes:

            $ python manage.py migrate
            $ python manage.py runserver


    7) Through the Config-folder, open the settings.py file:
    
        7.1) Organize the settings.py header:

            # App Essential Settings:
            BASE_DIR = ...
            SECRET_KEY = ...
            DEBUG = ...
            ALLOWED_HOSTS = ...

            # App Essential Info:
            BRAND_NAME = 'Brand Name'
            BRAND_EMAIL = 'brand_email@domain.com'
            BRAND_URL = 'https://branddomain.com'
            DEV_NAME = 'ABCOO'
            DEV_URL = 'https://abcoo.com.br'
            ADMIN_EMAIL = 'aldolammel@gmail.com'


        7.2) Prepare a Global Context with the Essentioal info about the app:
                /33-Web-development/general/django/3-2-backend-views/1-building-views-context/global-context.txt
        

        7.3) Still in settings.py file, if you won't use the SQLite as database,
            keep in mind your 'SECRET KEY';


        7.4) Define your database:
            /33-Web-development/general/django/3-1-backend-models-database/0-installing-and-adminUser/1-define-your-database/


    8) Set the environment variables and create your .env file:
        /33-Web-development/general/django/1-install-and-first-steps/environment-variables-django.py



    9) Create the 'templates' folder in the project-folder (Don't mistake with the config-folder);

        E.g. Django Project Structure:

            >Project-folder (it's the 'main-app', it's the root folder)
                >config-folder (same name of the project)
                    -settings.py (where you register each sub-app in use)
                    ...
                >sub-app1-folder
                    ...
                >sub-app2-folder
                    ...
                >sub-app3-folder
                    ...
                ...
                -manage.py


    10) Create your first sub-app in the project:

        10.1) Show to Django where will be each template folder in your sub-apps, going to the config-folder 'settings.py' file
            and editing this line in 'template' list:
                From:
                    'DIRS': [],
                To:
                    'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'],

        10.2) Do this: /33-Web-development/general/django/2-creating-and-deleting-apps/creating.txt


    11) Creating the admin user:
        $ python manage.py createsuperuser
        # Now, try to login, making sure the main-app is running:
        $ python manage.py runserver
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/



    12) Will this project have more than one language?

            If not, add in your settings.py:
                USE_I18N = False
                
            Otherwise:
                /33-Web-development/general/django/8-translate-and-internationalization/starting-translation.txt
    

    13) Optionals:

        13.1) Will you use file upload?
            /33-Web-development/general/django/5-uploads/files/

        13.2) Will you use imagem upload?
            /33-Web-development/general/django/5-uploads/images/
