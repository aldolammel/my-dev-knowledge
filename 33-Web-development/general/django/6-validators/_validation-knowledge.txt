    VALIDATION KNOWLEDGE:


        >> FOR FORMS AND MODELS:

            Djangoâ€™s form (and model) fields support use of utility functions and classes known
            as validators. A validator is a callable object or function that takes a value and 
            returns nothing if the value is valid or raises a ValidationError if not. 


        >> CLEAN() METHOD:

            clean() is a built-in method that's used in forms and models for customize validations.

            Validators can be used to validate values inside the field:

                from django.core import validators
                from django.forms import CharField

                class SlugField(CharField):
                    default_validators = [validators.validate_slug]

            As you can see, SlugField is a CharField with a customized validator that validates
            that submitted text obeys to some character rules. This can also be done on field
            definition so:

                slug = forms.SlugField()

            is equivalent to:

                slug = forms.CharField(validators=[validators.validate_slug])
