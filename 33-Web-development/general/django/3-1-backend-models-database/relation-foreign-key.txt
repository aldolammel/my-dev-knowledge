RELATION: FOREIGN KEY

    Reminder: it's used to create a one-to-many relationship.


    1) (THIS IS THE FOREIGN) You got an app called 'team' and its models.py code is:

        class Team(models.Model):
            name = models.CharField(max_length=20)


    2) You got another app where this one is called 'clients'. In its models.py:

        from team.models import Team
        class Client(models.Model):
            team = models.ForeignKey(
                Team, 
                related_name='clients', 
                on_delete=models.CASCADE, 
                null=True,
            )
            name = models.CharField(max_length=20)


    3) Still in clients app, in admin.py:

        from .models import Client
        admin.site.register(Client)

    
    4) Run the CMS and check the if everything is fine.
