RELATION: MANY TO MANY

    >> It's used to create a many-to-many relationship where Django automatically
        creates an intermediary table (bridge) to manage the many-to-many relationship. 
        This table contains two foreign keys: one pointing to each of the related models. 
        This intermediary table is not directly visible in the models but is present 
        in the database schema.

    >> If you need an attribute contains many id's in, you must use a ManyToMany
        releationship.

        E.g.

            class AffectedArea(models.Model):
                # This table (class) will receive many entries (areas) that will be shown
                # on 'affected_areas' checkbox field in 'HeadacheAttack' class.

                area = models.CharField(max_length=40)                   
                    
                def __str__(self):
                    return self.area


            class HeadacheAttack(models.Model):
                affected_areas = models.ManyToManyField(
                    AffectedArea,  # calling the class that the relation many-to-many must be created.
                )
