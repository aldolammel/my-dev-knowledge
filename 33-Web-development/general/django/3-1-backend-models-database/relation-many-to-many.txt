RELATION: MANY TO MANY

    >> It's used to create a many-to-many relationship where Django automatically
        creates an intermediary table (bridge) to manage the many-to-many relationship. 
        This table contains two foreign keys: one pointing to each of the related models. 
        This intermediary table is not directly visible in the models but is present 
        in the database schema.

    >> If you need an attribute contains one or maybe many id's in, you must use a ManyToMany
        releationship.

        E.g.
            
            /33-Web-development/general/django/3-1-backend-models-database/field-select-menu-multiple.txt


    >> ManyToMany doesn't need the on_delete argument because if some list option is deleted, 
        Django will delete the reference directly in the brigde table (mapping) created
        automatically in ManyToManyField releationship.
