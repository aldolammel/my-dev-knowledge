USERS SETUP

    >> If your project needs any kind of user management, you must use these settings!
    
    >> They are built-in features of Django, so do not change anything! 


    1) Create a sub-app called 'accounts' and add it in the config-folder settings.py
        file as 'accounts' in 'Installed Apps' list;
