HOW TO RE-INSTALL ONLY THE DATABASE:

    >> If you need to re-create your database from the beginning, do it:

        1) Delete the current database;

        2) Create the new database;

        3) Through each sub-app migration-folder, delete all its content, except the dunder init;

        4) Edit your .env file as needed;

        5) CRITICAL: close all Terminals/Prompts you ran with the old .env before (it avoids
            issues with old environment variables)!

        6) Run 'makemigrations' for each sub-app, and then run 'migrate';
        
        7) If you'll use the CMS, run createsuperuser;
