    >> If you want to create a field that will be filled based in another one, keep reading this:



        E.g.

            # You got a 'birthdate' field and want to fill the 'age' field automatically and
            # only by the system:

            from datetime import date

            class Ninja(models.Model):
                ...
                birthdate = models.DateField(blank=True);
                age = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(editable=False, blank=True)

                def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    # Calculate the user's age based on their existent birthdate:
                    if self.birthdate:
                        today = date.today()
                        born = self.birthdate
                        self.age = today.year - born.year - ((today.month, today.day) < (born.month, born.day))
                    #
                    super().save(*args, **kwargs)
