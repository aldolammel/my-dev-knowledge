RELATION: ITSELF


    >> Relation with the same model:

        # Example 1:
        class User(models.Model):
            ...
            friends = models.ManyToManyField(
                'self',
            ) 
        
            
        # Example 2:
        class User(AbstractUser):
            ...
            updated_by = models.ForeignKey(
                'self',  # Itself relationship!
                related_name='updated_users',
                on_delete=models.SET_NULL,  # if the user-updater is deleted, the updated_by field is null.
                null=True,
            )



        >> The special self keyword (used as a string value) tells Django that it should form a
            relationship with (other) instances of the same model.
