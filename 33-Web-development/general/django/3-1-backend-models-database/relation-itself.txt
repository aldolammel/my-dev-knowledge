RELATION: ITSELF


    >> Relation with the same model:

        class User(models.Model):
            ...
            friends = models.ManyToManyField('self') 
        
            >> The special self keyword (used as a string value) tells Django that it should form a
            relationship with (other) instances of the same model.
