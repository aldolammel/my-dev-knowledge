MODELS.PY:


    NULL vs BLANK

        >> 'blank True' means the field is not mandatory.
        >> 'null True' means, if the field is empty, in db the value is storage as 'null', not empty.

            E.g. description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)


    ON_DELETE CASCADE

        >> If you use 'on_delete=models.CASCADE' in a models.py class, you are saying the entire
            database content related with a foreign key must be deleted as well along the foreign key.
            
            E.g. category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
