    UPDATING A TRANSLATION PROJECT:

        There are two approaches:

            I) Update the original language used on templates, views and models;
                
                >> Crucial: the original language (msgid) NEVER be updated directly in a .po file!

            II) Update a translation;

                >> Crucial: a translation (msgstr) is updated only through its .po file!




        >> Update the original language used on templates, views and models:
            
            
            1) Update the original text (models, views and templates);

            
            2) Re-generate each language .po file;

                E.g.

                    $ django-admin makemessages -l pt_BR

                    or 

                    $ django-admin makemessages --all


                    >> After that, test the product. If everything is fine, open the 'django.po'
                        from the specific language you've been updated and delete all 'fuzzy' lines and those
                        comment lines with old texts, except those in lines number 6, 7 and 8.
                        This will keep to file clean!



            4) Just to make sure, compile the translations again:

                $ django-admin compilemessages



        >> Update only the translation in a language (.po) file:
