    TRANSLATING: MODELS


        >> Open all your models.py you want to translate the database values too, and convert 
            the original models.Model class to TranslatableModel class:

                E.g.

                    from parler.models import TranslatableModel, TranslatedFields

                    class Movie(TranslatableModel):
                        translations = TranslatedFields(
                            title=models.CharField(...),
                            sinopsys=models.CharField(...),
                        )

                        director = ...
                        year_released = ...

                        ...

                Crucial:

                    >> There is a known issue where after 'makemessages' command, the migration
                        file will be created as usual, but when you perform the 'migrate'
                        command, you'll get an error. To fix that, do it:

                        1) Open your latest migration file in the targeted sub-app;
                        2) Find the line 'bases=(parler.models.TranslatedFieldsModelMixin, models.Model),';
                        3) Replace the 'TranslatedFieldsModelMixin' by 'TranslatableModel' and
                            make sure you saved the file;
                        4) Perform the 'migrate' command;
                        5) Go to the next step (tests only after that!);
