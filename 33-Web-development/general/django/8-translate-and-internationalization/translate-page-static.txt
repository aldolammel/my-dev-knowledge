        >> Using Gettext directly on template:

            E.g. simplest way:

                {% load i18n %}
               
                {% blocktrans %}
                    <p>
                        We are a company dedicated to helping people <strong>track their
                        headache attacks</strong>. Our mission is to provide <em>simple, 
                        efficient, and user-friendly</em> solutions to help users manage 
                        their health effectively.
                    </p>
                {% endblocktrans %}

            
            E.g. solid way (focused only to translate text, not its features):

                {% load i18n %}
               
                {% blocktrans with p_tag='<p>' strong_tag='<strong>' em_tag='<em>' p_end='</p>' strong_end='</strong>' em_end='</em>' %}
                    {{ p_tag }}
                        We are a company dedicated to helping people {{ strong_tag }}track their headache attacks{{ strong_end }}. 
                        Our mission is to provide {{ em_tag }}simple, efficient, and user-friendly{{ em_end }} solutions 
                        to help users manage their health effectively.
                    {{ p_end }}
                {% endblocktrans %}
