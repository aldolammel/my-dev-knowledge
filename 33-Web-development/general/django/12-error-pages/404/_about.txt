ERROR 404 INFORMATION: 

    >> When Debug mode is false, Django looks automatically for the 404.html
        file in the project global 'templates' folder, making unnecessary to set it in urls.py files.

    >> Since DEBUG=False, Django relies on the web server to serve static files, and you must
        ensure all static files (including admin CSS) are collected into the STATIC_ROOT 
        directory by running:

        $ python manage.py collectstatic

        It'll create the 'staticfiles' folder in the project folder.

    >> Debug Mode can be customized through Django config-folder file called 'settings.py' or
        in '.env' file. More about in:
