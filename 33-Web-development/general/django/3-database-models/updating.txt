UPDATING

If you performe any modification in a models.py file, you must execute the migration again:
    # Convert all new python instructions of each modified app of the project to SQL instructions:
    # For all apps in the same time:
    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    # Or for each of them separately:
    $ python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>
    
    # check the files in the app migrations folder, and, if everything is okay, do it:
    $ python manage.py migrate
