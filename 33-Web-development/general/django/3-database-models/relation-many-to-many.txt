RELATION: MANY TO MANY

    >> It's used to create a many-to-many relationship where Django automatically
        creates an intermediary table (bridge) to manage the many-to-many relationship. 
        This table contains two foreign keys: one pointing to each of the related models. 
        This intermediary table is not directly visible in the models but is present 
        in the database schema.

    >> If you need an attribute contains many id's in, you must use a ManyToMany
        releationship.
