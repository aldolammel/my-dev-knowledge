INHERITING COMMON ATTRIBUTES:


    >> Imagine you re-using common attributes almost are used in all your tables
        like 'created_at', 'updated_at' and 'created_by'. Check this out:


        class Common(models.Model):
            created_at = ...
            created_by = ...
            updated_at = ...
            updated_by = ...

            class Meta:
                # It will flag the database to don't create this table:
                abstract = True

        
        class Post(Common):
            title = ...
            content = ...


        class Comment(Common):
            message = ...

    
    >> CRITICAL: to avoid errors, remove any foreign key or many-to-many attribute 
        from your abstracted/inherited class!
