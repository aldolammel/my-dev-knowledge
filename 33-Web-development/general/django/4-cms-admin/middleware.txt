MIDDLEWARE

    >> It's a framework of hooks into Django's request/response processing. It's a light,
        low-level 'plugin' system for globally altering Django's input or output.

        People --> Request something ---> Middleware area --------------> Server
            <--- Response for something  <--- Middleware area  <---
            

    >> Each middleware component is responsible for doing some specific function.
        E.g. 'AuthenticationMiddleware' is a default Django's component that associates
            users with requests using sessions.


    >> It's correct to say that Middlewares are the middle of the way, codes that can intercept
        something before to reach the server (intercepting the request) or 
        before to reach the people (intercepting the response).
