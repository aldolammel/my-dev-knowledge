DYNAMIC OPTIONS: SELECT MENU

    >> If you want to build a class/table where you select week by week an 'Artist of the week',
        and you got new artists to consider always, you should create an Artist() class/table
        to save all artists you want as option. In the sub-app models.py file...
        
        
        1) Create both classes:

                class Artist(models.Model):
                    name = ...

                class ArtistOfWeek(models.Model):
                    week = ...
                    artist_selected = ...


        2) In the same code snippet, lets create a releationship between both classes through
            a foreign key:

                class ArtistOfWeek(models.Model):
                    week = ...
                    artist_selected = models.ForeignKey(Artist, on_delete=models.CASCADE)


        3) In admin.py file:
            
                from .models import Artist, ArtistOfWeek


                class ArtistCMS(admin.ModelAdmin):
                    list_display = ('id', 'name')


                class ArtistOfWeekCMS(admin.ModelAdmin):
                    list_display = ('id', 'week', 'artist_selected')


                admin.site.register(Artist, ArtistCMS)
                admin.site.register(ArtistOfWeek, ArtistOfWeekCMS)


        4) Run the commands:
                
                $ python manage.py makemigrations <subapp_name>
                $ python manage.py migrate
                $ python manage.py runserver
