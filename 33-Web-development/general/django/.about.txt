INSTALLING DJANGO:


1) Create the project folder, and get it:
    $ mkdir <project_folder>
    $ cd <project_folder>


2) Create the virtual environment and active it:
    <Check the folder '03-Virtual-Environment'>


3) Update the pip:
    <Check the folder '04-Basic-Modules'>


4) Install Django:
    $ pip install django


5) Create the Django Project Structure:
    # make sure you're in project root folder and:
    $ django-admin startproject proj_<project_name> .


6) Make sure you're in the same folder the 'manage.py' file, and then start the django for testing purposes:
    $ python manage.py runserver


7) In root of the project, create each app of your project:
    $ python manage.py startapp <app_name>

8) Create the urls.py file into each app created, adding the urlpatterns list in each file;
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views
    urlpatters = [path('', views.index)]

9) Through the views.py into each app created, add a function with each pattern created in the app urlpatterns;
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    def index():
        return HttpResponse('Hello world')

10) Go to your main project app (often the same name of the project) and open its urls.py file and include
    each app url references right after the admin line:
    from django.urls import path, include
    path("<app_name>/", include("<app_name>.urls"))

11) Still in main project app, go to 'settings.py' file and add each app name in the 'INSTALLED_APPS' list.
    '<app_name>',
    '<app_name>',

12) Test your app, running it:
    $ python manage.py runserver
