FORMS: STEP BY STEP (USING FORMS BASED IN MODELS)


    0) Make sure you already have a models.py class created that will create the model to 
        the template/front-end form:

            /33-Web-development/general/django/3-1-backend-models-database/_creating_db_table.py


    1) In the same sub-app folder of your models.py, create a file called 'forms.py';


    2) In new 'forms.py' file, create a form class linked with its models.py class brother:

        /33-Web-development/general/django/9-forms/class-based/inherit-ModelForm/forms.py


    3) In the sub-app views.py, create views.py function or class responsable for your
        form to be used in a template:

        /33-Web-development/general/django/3-2-backend-views/


    4) In the sub-app urls.py file, add the URL of your new view 
        (responsable for your front-end form):

        /33-Web-development/general/django/3-2-backend-views/2-building-urls/


    5) If your sub-app folder there is NO 'templates' folder, create it;
    
    
        5.1) In 'templates' folder, create a folder with the same name of your sub-app;
        5.2) In that new folder in 'templates' folder, create your template html file and
            call your form over there:

                /33-Web-development/general/django/3-3-frontend-templates/2-calling-a-form.txt
