    ERROR MESSAGES: BASIC



        >> Django Forms and its default error messages:
        
            If a Model Class has no 'blank=True' or has declared 'blank=False', Django Forms
            will automatically set the form field as REQUIRED, including the error message 
            'This field is required.' when the field is empty for submitting.

        


        >> Model argument 'error_messages={}':

            It is the most reliable and solid way to ensure that anything that causes an infraction 
            for a given attribute will generate the planned error message. However, this method is 
            server-side, that is, it is handled by the server and not by the client machine.

                <example here> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


        >> Error messages on forms (templates):

            It is the client-side alternative, that is, with no or almost no resources being
            required from the server.
