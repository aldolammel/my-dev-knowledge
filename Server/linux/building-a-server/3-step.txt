Building a new server > 3) Deploy the Web Application:
Install Python
Before you install Python on Linux VPS, you should check whether it's already installed by default (probably yes):
$ python3 --version
If you want to update the Python version, it's advised to remove the old one to avoid two or more Python version running:
$ sudo apt-get -y purge python3.8   # or the version you wanna remove!
$ sudo apt-get -y autoremove
Preparing for Python new version:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt update
$ apt list | grep python3.12
If the output is similar to this below, everything is fine:

Install that Python version:
$ sudo apt install python3.12
$ python3.12 --version    # to confirm that it's installed
Install pip:
$ sudo apt install python3-pip -y

$ python3 -m pip --version

Installing a database
For SQLite3
This option already comes with Ubuntu, but check if everything is ok:
$ sqlite3 --version
If no SQLite is installed:
$ sudo apt install sqlite3 -y

Installing a web application

Bring it from the repository
In the terminal, check where you are (path):
$ pwd
Go to "/home/<your_non_root_user>/" and create the project folder. Example:
/home/admin/
Create the application folder:
$ mkdir <project_name_folder>
$ cd <project_name_folder>
In the new folder, clone your project repo from GitHub here:
$ git clone <ssh_project_link> .        # This '.' means the repo files will be installed in the current folder.
GitHub will ask for the Public Key password. It's here:   as "SSH Public Key" pass.

Temporary replacement of your main.py for the simplest version for testing purposes
For Flask web application:
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/")
def go_start():
    return "<h1>Hello world!</h1>"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # app.run(debug=True)
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0")  # This IP is a special that forces Flask to run in all machines with app access.


Create a virtual environment
In the current project directory, create a new venv (to my portfolio = venv_p). 
# From anywhere, install the virtualenv on the server:
$ sudo pip install virtualenv

# Go again to the application folder:
$ cd <project_name_folder>
# Check if right:
$ pwd

# create the venv in the current path you are (/var/www/<project_name_folder>):
$ sudo virtualenv <venv_name_project>
Example of output after that:

# Active the environment:
$ . <venv_name_project>/bin/activate
#or
$ source <venv_name_project>/bin/activate

# Confirm the venv is successfully selected:
$ which python3
# You should see the virtual environment path pointing right in your web application folder.

Are you having any trouble installing the modules in the right venv?
Try to do that with the root user.

Installing VPS-side modules
Still in the root project folder and on the right virtualenv selected, install the vps-side modules:
# Check if the modules are present on the virtual environment modules installed list:
$ python3 -m pip list

# install:
$ sudo pip install wheel        # probably already installed.
$ sudo pip install gunicorn     # WSGI

# Check again:
$ python3 -m pip list
Installing all application modules
After that, run the web application requirements.txt file:
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check if the modules are present on the virtual environment modules installed list:
$ python3 -m pip list
Firewall update
Python running on the web uses port 5000
$ sudo ufw allow 5000
Environment Variables (system-wide global variables)
If you're using it, let's edit this file:
$ sudo nano /etc/environment

# Add all your environment variables like the example:
YOUR_VAR_NAME_1="VALUE_1_HERE"
YOUR_VAR_NAME_2="VALUE_2_HERE"
It should be like this:

Save it (ctrl+s) and exit (ctrl+x).
Logout and reconnect to initiate the new config:
$ exit
$ ssh -p <port_number> <user>@<server_ip>
Check whether environment variables are listed on the system correctly:
$ printenv
Test it (without WSGI yet): [ If it's a complex file with db, it doesn't work in this stage of configuration. Recommended to test first with a simple .py file] 
# in the root of project folder, make sure you are in the correct virtual environment:
$ . <venv_name>/bin/activate
$ python <project_main_file>.py
# if no environ variable error, check your web browser: http://<server_ip>:5000
The port is already in use?
If so, do it:
$ ps -fA | grep python
Example: 
root       10445   10351  0 19:20 pts/1    00:00:00 /var/www/portfolio/venv_portf/bin/python /var/www/portfolio/venv_portf/bin/flask run
The process id (pid) is the second number (10351). So if you want to use the default port (5000), stop the process that is using it:
$ kill 10351
