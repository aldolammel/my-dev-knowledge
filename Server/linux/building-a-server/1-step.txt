DEBIAN/UBUNTU > BUILDING UP A WEB-SERVER: OS

Building a new server:
Connect to the server
You bought a VPS at your favorite provider; the first thing to do is log into it. Usually, you receive an email with the credentials required to connect. 
Open your local terminal and:
    
    $ ssh -p <port> <user>@<server_ip_address>

# Example:
    $ ssh -p 22 root@43.206.85.179
Say yes, and congratulations, you're inside the server. Let's continue with the next step.
Public Key error?
If you have no other servers to worry about deleting the "known_hosts" file, delete it:
Windows OS:
<WINDOWS_DRIVE>:\Users\<your_user>\.ssh\known_hosts
Ubuntu OS:
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OS version
If the server has a Ubuntu installed, check its current version:
$ lsb_release -a
If it needed to be upgraded:
Crucial: do all processes directly on the server terminal (available by hosting panel), and not remote ssh from a local machine. 
Update the repo list and the current OS version:
$ apt update

$ apt upgrade -y        # this "-y" say yes when the user is asked to keep the upgrading.
Install the Update Manager and, after that, reboot the server:
$ apt install update-manager-core

$ reboot
Start the Ubuntu upgrade:
$ do-release-upgrade
When the upgrade has been finished, reboot again.
