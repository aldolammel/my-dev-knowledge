Building a new server > 4) Deploy the Database
Exception: nowadays, in my portfolio repo, it's included the database (not recommended but in my case it's ok), the this step must be skipped.

For sure it's not the correct way to perform a db deployment, but me, Aldo, it works:
Local > put the DB in the root of the application, without changing its paths in the .py file (because it's a temporary approach);
Local > add it to the repository on git and push it:
$ git add --all
$ git commit -a -m "some message"
$ git push
Server > create the correct folder to deploy the db:
# check if you're into your web application folder:
$pwd

# if so, create a new folder called "instance":
$ mkdir instance 

# Move the db to its right place:
$ mv <db_name> instance
Local > return the db to "instance" folder;
Local > update the repo:
$ git add --all
$ git commit -a -m "some message"
$ git push
Server > update the repo:
$ git pull
Server > list the project folder content to check if it's ok (with instance folder too, with its db inside, and no db in the project root):
$ ls
$ cd instance
$ ls
$ cd ..
