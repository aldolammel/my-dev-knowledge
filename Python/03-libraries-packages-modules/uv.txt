PYTHON PACKAGE MANAGEMENT: UV PACKAGE


    >> Extremely fast Python package installer and resolver designed as a drop-in replacement for
        pip and pip-tools workflows.

        https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

    >> When you ask to UV to initiate a project, a "uv.lock" file is created automatically,
        garanteeing that all copies of this project will have the same dependencies (like a Docker).

    >> If you lose your virtual environment folder, you can recreate the venv using "uv sync"
        command to re-install the project dependencies fast and easily.

    >> Linux and MacOS:
        $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        or
        $ wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    
    >> Windows:
        $ powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
        $ winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
