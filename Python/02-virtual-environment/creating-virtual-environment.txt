VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT:

    A virtual environment is a way to have multiple, parallel instances of the Python interpreter, each with different sets of packages and different configurations. Each virtual environment contains a discrete copy of the Python interpreter, including copies of its support utilities.
    
    The packages installed in each virtual environment are seen only in that virtual environment and no other. Even large, complex packages with platform-dependent binaries can be corralled off from each other in virtual environments.

    >> There is 2 methods to create a virtual environment by terminal:
        
        A) by Python built-in command;
        B) by installing a module called virtualenv;
        C) by UV Package Manager (RECOMMENDED);

    A) With Python built-in solution:

        >> Creating:

            UBUNTU:
                $ sudo apt install python3-venv
                    # In the project folder:
                        $ python3 -m venv .<venv_name>  <-- add that dot "." to make it a hidden
                                                            folder and be automatically ignore by gitignore file.
            
            WINDOWS:
                $ py -m venv .<venv_name>
            
            
            Mac:
                $ python3 -m venv .<venv_name>


        >> Deleting (if needed):

            Windows:
                $ rmdir <venv_name>
        
            Debian/Ubuntu:
                # Deactivate the virtual environment first:
                    $ deactivate 

                # Delete the virtual environment folder (be aware if the folder has or not '.'):
                    $ rm -r <venv_name>

                # Check if deleted (-a to consider the hidden files/folders too):
                    $ ls -a
        
            Mac:
                $ xxxx



    B) With virtualenv module:

        >> Creating:

            B1) GO to the terminal;
            B2) Go to the folder that you want to install the virtual environment;
            B3) In the folder, type through Terminal to create the virtual environment: 
                
                $ virtualenv <venv_unique_name>
            
                If the command wasn't recognized, install the virtualenv module: 
                
                $ python3 -m pip install virtualenv


        >> Deleting (if needed):
            
            Windows:
                $ xxx

            Debian/Ubuntu:
                
                # Deactivate the virtual environment first:
                    $ deactivate 

                # Check the project folder path:
                    $ pwd

                # Delete the virtual environment folder (be aware if the folder has or not '.'):
                    $ rm -rf /path/to/.venv/

                # Check if deleted (-a to consider the hidden files/folders too):
                    $ ls -a

            Mac:
                $ xxxx


        C) With UV Package Manager:
