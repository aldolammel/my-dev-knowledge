PYTHON: GARBAGE COLLECTION

    What is it:
        /Programming-Concepts/garbage-collector.txt

    Even Python working with an automatic solution, Python is not allowed to deal with circular relations. For this case, the manual gargabe collection should be executed!








    >> GC in manual control:

        import gc

        # Checking if it's allowed:
        print(gc.isenabled())  # True por padrão

        # Forcing the manual collection:
        gc.collect()

        # Turning it off (not recommended, only in specific scenarios):
        gc.disable()

        # Check the generation stats:
        print(gc.get_count())  # (threshold0, threshold1, threshold2)

        # See tracked objects by GC:
        print(len(gc.get_objects()))
