PYTHON: HOW TO UPLOAD A FILE

    1) Which way you wanna create the HTML form:
        
        1A) Building that manually with form tag and its input fields;
            /HTML/form/files-upload.txt
        
        1B) Or building that dynamically using a framework:
            Just skip this, going to the next step!
        

    2) Which Web development framework are you using:

        >> Only Python (if you take this way, the 1A step is mandatory):
            ./files-upload-raw-python.txt
        
        >> Django:
            /Python/Web-development/django/5-uploads/django-upload-image-p1.txt

        >> FastAPI:
            /Python/Web-development/fast-api/5-uploads/files-upload-with-fastapi.txt
        
        >> Flask:
            /Python/Web-development/flask/uploads/files-upload-with-flask.txt

        >> React:
            /xxxxxxxxxxxxx
        
        >> Angular:
            /xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
