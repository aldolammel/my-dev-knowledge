PYTHON: COMPREHENSIONS

    They are concise syntactic constructs for creating collections (lists, dictionaries, sets) from existing iterables in a single, readable line of code. Comprehensions are a powerful Python feature that makes code more expressive and Pythonic!

    Use comprehensions when:
    - The logic is simple and fits on one line.
    - You're creating a new collection from an existing one.
    - Readability is improved.

    >> List Comprehension:
        ./list-comprehension.py

    >> Dict Comprehension:
        ./dict-comprehension.py

    >> Set Comprehension:
        ./set-comprehension.py
