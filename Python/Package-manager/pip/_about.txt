PYTHON PACKAGE MANAGEMENT: PIP (PYTHON BUILT-IN MODULE)


    ATTENTION: Uv is much more efficient and modern than pip:
                /Python/Package-manager/uv.txt


    That said, let's go:


    >> It's a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like. 
        Note: If you have Python version 3.4 or later, PIP is included by default.


        1) Make sure you are in the right Python Interpreter in your IDE.
            PyCharm: check the right-lower-corner;
            VSCode: press Ctrl+Shift+P and type 'Python Interpreter'


        2) Active your environment:
            /Python/02-virtual-environment/


        3) Now, do it:

            Windows:
                $ py -m pip install --upgrade pip
            
            Debian/Ubuntu:

                # Just for make sure even the system apps list is updated:
                $ sudo apt update
            
                # Updating the own Module manager of Python (PIP):
                $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

            Mac:
                $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
