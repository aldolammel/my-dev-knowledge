PYTHON PACKAGE MANAGEMENT: UV


    Extremely fast Python package installer and resolver designed as a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools workflows.

        https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

    When you ask to UV to initiate a project, a "uv.lock" file is created automatically, guaranteeing that all copies of this project will have the same dependencies (like a Docker);

    Tip: UV is developed by the same company of the Ruff Linter/Formatter, so both are completely integrated.
