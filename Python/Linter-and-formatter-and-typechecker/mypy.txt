PYTHON LANGUAGE > TYPE CHECKER: MYPY


    By Microsoft, it's an optional static type checker for Python that aims to combine the benefits 
    of dynamic (or "duck") typing and static typing. Mypy combines the expressive power and
    convenience of Python with a powerful type system and compile-time type checking.
