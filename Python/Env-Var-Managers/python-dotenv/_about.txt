PYTHON ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE MANAGER: PYTHON-DOTENV

    This is the most common and straightforward environment variable manager. It reads key-value
    pairs from a .env file and loads them into your environment variables, making them accessible
    via os.getenv().

    Examples (Do not use then):
        /Python/Env-Var-Managers/python-dotenv/examples/.env
        /Python/Env-Var-Managers/python-dotenv/examples/example.py
