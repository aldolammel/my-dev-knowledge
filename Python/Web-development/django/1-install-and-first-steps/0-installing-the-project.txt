INSTALLING DJANGO:

    BASIC I) Python installation:
        
        /Python/01-python-installation/
        
    
    BASIC II) If you are RE-installing Django, skip all of this, and following only this one:

        /Python/Web-development/django/1-install-and-first-steps/reinstall-new-django-copy.txt


    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


    1) Create the project folder, and get it:

        $ mkdir <project_folder>
        $ cd <project_folder>


    2) Define the method to install Django:

        2A) Using UV package (recommended, more professional)!
        2B) Or using common method, more manual (pip).

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
    
        2A) Using UV package:
            If you want to use the UV package, follow this:
            /Python/Web-development/django/1-install-and-first-steps/1-install-with-uv-package.txt

        2B) Using common method (pip):

            2B-PRE.1) Keep this in mind: Django project folder's structure!
                    /Python/Web-development/django/django-project-folder-structure.txt

            2B-PRE.2) Create your project folder (where you will develop the product)!

            2B.1) Inside the project folder, create the virtual environment and active it:
                    /Python/02-virtual-environment/

            2B.2) (OPTIONAL) Make sure you got your .gitignore updated with: Django, environment
                            and other things!
                
            2B.3) Installation:

                >> The same for Ubuntu and Windows:

                    >> Update pip module:
                        /Python/03-libraries-packages-modules/pip.txt

                    >> Install Django:
                        $ pip install django

                    >> Check the current django installed:
                        $ python -m django --version

                    >> upgrade django if needed;
                        $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
                

                Only for VSCode:
                    # DjLint (html template formatter for django/jinja)
                        $ pip install -U djlint
                    
                    # Install the DjLint extension for VSCode.
                    # Install the Django (by Baptiste) extension for VSCode.
                    # In VSCode, In Html's, change the language mode to 'Django-Html'

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


    3) Create the Django Project Structure:

        # make sure you're in project root folder and:
            $ django-admin startproject core .          <-- This dot's important!
        Or
            $ uv run django-admin startproject core .   <-- This dot's important!


    4) Make sure you're in the same folder the 'manage.py' file, and then start the django
        
        4.1) for testing purposes:

            # 1/3:
                $ python manage.py migrate
            or
                $ uv run manage.py migrate

            # 2/3:
                $ python manage.py runserver
            or
                $ uv run manage.py runserver

            # 3/3:
            http://localhost:8000/

        4.2) Create the project information file:

            - Create: 'pyproject.toml' in the project root;
            - Template of the file content:
                /Python/Web-development/pyproject.toml


    5) Through the Config-folder (e.g. "core"), open the settings.py file:
    
        x.1) (Skip it if you'll use an existent settings.py model later)
            Organize the settings.py header:

            # App Essential Settings:
            BASE_DIR = ...
            SECRET_KEY = ...
            DEBUG = ...
            ALLOWED_HOSTS = ...


        x.2) Prepare a Global Context with the Essential info about the app:
                /Python/Web-development/django/3-2-backend-views/1-building-views-context/global-context.txt
        

        x.3) Still in settings.py file, if you WON'T use the SQLite as database:

                >> If you'll use an settings.py model later, save this SECRET KEY to use in the
                    new settings.py later!


        x.4) Define your database:
            /Python/Web-development/django/3-1-backend-models-database/0-installing-and-adminUser/1-define-your-database/


    6) Set the environment variables and create your .env file:
        /Python/Web-development/django/1-install-and-first-steps/environment-variables-django.py



    7) Create the main 'templates' folder in the project-folder (Don't mistake with the core-folder):

        E.g. Django Project Structure:

            >Project-folder (it's the 'main-app' / the root folder)
                >.venv
                >core (it's the config-folder, sometimes with the same name of the project)
                    -settings.py (where you register each sub-app in use)
                    ...
                >sub-app1-folder
                    ...
                >sub-app2-folder
                    ...
                >sub-app3-folder
                    ...
                >media-folder
                    ...
                >static-folder
                    ...
                -manage.py
                ...


    8) Create the 'static' folder in the project-folder too!

        >> In static-folder, create a 'css' folder and a 'js' folder.
        >> in css-folder, create a 'main.css' file.
        >> in js-folder, create a 'main.js' file.


    9) Create the 'media' folder in the project-folder too!

        >> Keep it empty for now.


    10) Create basic sub-apps in the project's application:

        x.1) (Skip it if you'll use an existent settings.py model later) 
            Show to Django where will be each template folder in your sub-apps, going to the
            core-folder 'settings.py' file and editing this line in 'template' list:
                
                From:
                    'DIRS': [],
                To:
                    'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'],


        x.2) If you want to use a settings.py model file, now is the time!
            /Python/Web-development/django/z-project-examples/proj-aldolammel-style/core/settings.py
            
            >> Don't forget to uncomment (of delete) those "TODO:" lines in the settings.py model
                file when you bring it to your project!

            >> Keep commented the Installed sub-apps for now!


        x.3) Adding sub-apps:

            
            >> How to create a sub-app:
                /Python/Web-development/django/2-creating-and-deleting-apps/creating.txt


            >> (I STILL THINKING IF THIS IS NECESSARY!!!!!!!)
                'general' sub-app:
                About: /Python/Web-development/django/z-project-examples/proj-aldolammel-style/general/_readme.txt
                
                g.1) Bring the basic sub-app files and templates-folder too:
                    
                    /Python/Web-development/django/z-project-examples/proj-aldolammel-style/general/

                g.2) Include it in the INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.py file!
                g.3) Makemigrations and migrate!
                g.4) Test it!


            >> Do you need user management through the application front-end too?

                >> If not:
                    /Python/Web-development/django/3-1-backend-models-database/3-users/1-basic-users-only-for-cms.txt

                >> If so:
                    /Python/Web-development/django/3-1-backend-models-database/3-users/2-extending-users.txt


                    >> (I STILL THINKING IF THIS IS NECESSARY!!!!!!! BUT IF SO, ONLY IF ACCOUNTS WAS NEEDED TOO)
                    'in' sub-app:
                    About: /Python/Web-development/django/z-project-examples/proj-aldolammel-style/in/_readme.txt
                    
                    i.1) Bring the basic sub-app files and templates-folder too:
                        
                        /Python/Web-development/django/z-project-examples/proj-aldolammel-style/in/

                    i.2) Include it in the INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.py file!
                    i.3) Makemigrations and migrate!
                    i.4) Test it!


    11) Creating the admin user:
        
        $ python manage.py createsuperuser
        or
        $ uv run manage.py createsuperuser

        # Now, try to login, making sure the main-app is running:
        $ python manage.py runserver
        or 
        $ uv run manage.py runserver

        # Go to:
        http://localhost:8000/admin/



    12) (Skip it if you'll use an existent settings.py model later)
        Will this project have more than one language?

            If not, add in your settings.py:
                USE_I18N = False
                
            Otherwise:
                /Python/Web-development/django/8-translate-and-internationalization/1-starting-translation.txt
    

    13) Optionals:

        x.1) Will you use file upload?
            /Python/Web-development/django/5-uploads/

        x.2) Will you use image upload?
            /Python/Web-development/django/5-uploads/images/
