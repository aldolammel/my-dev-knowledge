DJANGO FORMS VALIDATIONS: FOR ALL LEVELS (MIXING SOLUTIONS)

    >> I'm using Django also as template solution:
        In this case, the best place to set the maximum of universal validations (that should impact DB, CMS, and APP) is models.py, using the DB constraints, validators, and clean() when needed.
        
    >> I'm NOT using Django as template solution:
        In this case, you must be the same commented above but keep in mind, when you use external template solution (like Vue, React, Angular) you PROBABLY need to replicate some APP-level validations in that front-end framework too.
