DJANGO FORMS VALIDATIONS: FOR ALL LEVELS (MIXING SOLUTIONS)

    >> I'm using Django also as template solution:
        In this case, the best place to set the maximum of universal validations (that should impact DB, CMS, and APP) is models.py, using these ways together:
        
            >> DB constraints validations:
                ./validation-1-for-database.txt
            
            >> Validations:
                ./models-validators-built-in.txt
            
            >> clean() method:
                ./clean-differences-between-model-and-form.txt
            
        
    >> Or I'm NOT using Django as template solution:
        In this case, you must be the same commented above but keep in mind, when you use external template solution (like Vue, React, Angular) you PROBABLY need to replicate some APP-level validations in that front-end framework too.
