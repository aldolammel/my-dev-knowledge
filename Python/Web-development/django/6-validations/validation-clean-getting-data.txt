DJANGO > CUSTOM VALIDATIONS: USING CLEAN() TO GET DATA AND THEN VALIDATE IT
    

    You got two clean() method approaches:

        >> Using clean() method in models.py:
            Built-in Model method used to provide custom model-level validation logic, and is called by full_clean() before save() the instance.

        >> Using clean() method in forms.py:
            Built-in Form method used to provide custom validation logic after field-level validation, but before the cleaned data's return.
