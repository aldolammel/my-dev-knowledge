    DJANGO > VALIDATIONS: CUSTOM MODEL VALIDATOR FOR M2M (SPECIAL CASE)

    Since this is a many-to-many field, we need to handle this differently than regular fields.
    There is ONLY one way to validate a m2m field, and it means do it just right AFTER the instance saving (yes, if user escape from browser without set the mandatory field, you got no that info)!

    >> For non-m2m fields:
