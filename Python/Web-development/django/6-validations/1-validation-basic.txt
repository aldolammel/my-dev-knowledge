DJANGO FORMS: VALIDATIONS
    
    The expression "Django Forms" refers to the form classes Django uses, including those in the admin (e.g., a new post form) and those used in the app’s front-end (e.g., a contact form). So, just to be clear, "Django Forms" mean Python classes (from django.forms) that handle rendering and validating user input. Django Forms represent:
        
    - Forms in the Django CMS (yes, these use Django Forms);
    - Forms in app's front-end (only if you're using Django's templating to create them);
    - API forms/serializers (but not including "Django REST Framework", it uses serializers).

    You can set form validations through 3 ways:

        >> Via MODELS.PY:

            Put validation in the Model if it’s a universal data integrity rule once it operates in database level, for example, "name cannot be empty", “price must be positive”, "start date is always equal or before the end date", etc.

        >> Via ADMIN.PY:

            Put validation in Admin if it’s about CMS-only restrictions (not including the app-user via front-end form), for example, “only staff can set discount”, "only admin can exceed the max-days available between start-date and end-date", etc.

        >> Via FORMS.PY:
        
            Put validation in Form if it’s about how the app-user data is input (UI-specific), for example, “price must not exceed user’s budget (visitor/depending on logged-in user)”, etc.

            Important: Form can be attached by an Admin Class (see this futher).

    EXAMPLES:

        >> Creating the basic and deepest validation directly in db (impact also CMS level):
            ./validation-1-for-database.txt
        
        >> Creating validation for CMS level:
            ./validation-3-for-CMS-forms.txt

        >> Creating validation for APP level:
            ./validation-2-for-app-forms.txt

        >> Creating validation for all levels (Database + CMS + APP);
            ./validation-4-for-everywhere.txt
