This is the core-folder (or main-app-folder or config-folder). Never set in here specialized sub-app
files or files for limited areas through the application. The files here are crucial for the
application health and are regularly used through all sub-apps.

E.g. of /core-folder/ extra content:

    - consts.py
    - context_processors.py
    - lang.py
