DJANGO: DEBUGGING


    >> Very basic:

        1) Create your environment variables, and add DEBUG=True in there!
            /Environment-Variables/env-for-local/in-backend/.env

        2) In core/settings.py, store that environment variable in a DEBUG var!
            /Python/Web-development/django/z-project-examples/proj-aldolammel-style/core/settings.py

        3) Now, just call the DEBUG wherever you need:
            /Python/Web-development/django/16-debug/calling-debug.py
