DJANGO STRUCTURE: VIEWS.PY


    >> Django is divided in 3 main parts: models, views, and templates.


    >> VIEWS:

        They are responsable for manage what data the user will see through a template. 
        The 'views.py' file contains all logic the user can see and which template/webpage the data
        will be seen.

        >> Views are also responsable for manage what data the users of the app can send to the 
            database and, actually, what data they can read/see.
            
        >> The 'views.py' file is closely related with 'urls.py' file, this one defining which view
            will be called in certain URL;

        >> Views are created through two ways apart:

                - function-base view: kwown as FBVs.
                - class-base view: known as CBVs (recommended)
        
        >> Through 'views.py' file you:

                - Handle user input and interact with models to retrieve data;
                - Render templates with the data obtained from models;
                - Return HTTP responses (like HTML, JSON, XML, etc).
