FEEDBACK MESSAGE IS NOT BEEN TRANSLATED:

    If you already have all django set to work with translations, but your feedback message keeps in a wrong language, the 
    problem is probably the session.

        >> How to fix it:
            /Python/Web-development/django/3-2-backend-views/4-user-profile-view/profile-view.py

                E.g.
                    # Update the session language to match the new preference:
                    # Important: keep it before the messages.success() to translate the message according to
                    # the new language if the user has changed it.
                    if 'language' in form.cleaned_data and form.cleaned_data['language']:
                        # Get the ISO code from the Language model instance:
                        language_code = form.cleaned_data['language'].iso_code
                        # Set the new language in the session:
                        translation.activate(language_code)
                        request.session['_language'] = language_code
                    # Feedback message:
                    messages.success(request, lng.TX_FDBK_PROFILE_SUCC_UPDATED)
