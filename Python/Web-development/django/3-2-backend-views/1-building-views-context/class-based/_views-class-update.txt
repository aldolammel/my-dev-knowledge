VIEWS CLASSES: USING UPDATE INHERIT:

    >> Provides a form for updating an existing object. It is similar to CreateView but 
        is used for editing existing objects;

        or editing a user profile;

        from django.views.generic import UpdateView
        from django.urls import reverse_lazy

        class BlogPostUpdateView(UpdateView):
            model = <ModelClass>
            fields = ['title', 'content']
            template_name = '<HtmlTemplatePath>'
            success_url = reverse_lazy('blogpost_list')
