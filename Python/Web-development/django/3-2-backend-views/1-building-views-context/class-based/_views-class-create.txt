VIEWS CLASSES: USING CREATE INHERIT:

    >> With 'CreateView' you don't need to create a form-class in forms.py when something simple;
    
    >> Provides a form for creating a new object and saving it to the database. It uses
        a model form to handle form validation and object creation;

    >> Perfect when you need to provide a view that allows users to create new objects, 
        such as submitting a new blog post or registering a new user;
                
    
    E.g.

        from django.views.generic import CreateView
        from django.urls import reverse_lazy

        class BlogPostCreateView(CreateView):
            model = <ModelClass>
            fields = ['title', 'content']
            template_name = '<HtmlTemplatePath>'
            success_url = reverse_lazy('blogpost_list')
