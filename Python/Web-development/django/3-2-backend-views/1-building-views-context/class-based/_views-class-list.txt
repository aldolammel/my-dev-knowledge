    >> A subclass of 'TemplateView' class designed for displaying a list of objects. 
        It automates the process of fetching data from a model and rendering it in a template.

    >> Perfect when you need to display a list of objects from a database, such as a category of pages or posts;
                

    E.g.

        from django.views.generic import ListView
        
        class ProductsListView(ListView):  # This 'View' in classname is a convention.
            model = <ModelClass>
            template_name = '<HtmlTemplatePath>'
            context_object_name = 'products'
