SESSION FEATURES:

    >> What is it: a ongoing-connection between a client-browser and server!

    >> The identification is NOT forever but the developer defines how long it will work;

    >> Data stored in a session persists as long as the session is active. So session preserves
        temporarily the client and server relation;

    >> Client sends to the server a cookie with their unique Session ID;

    >> Without the session, even logged users will be logout when page is reloaded or broser is closed;

        # How long the session cookie must survive, in secs:
