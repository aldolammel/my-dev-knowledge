DJANGO CORS HEADERS:

    It's a Django app designed to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers in responses
    from your Django app. CORS is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to restrict web
    pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.

    >> Install:

        # With PIP:
            $ python -m pip install django-cors-headers
        # With UV:
            $ uv add django-cors-headers


    >> Integration:

        1) Open the core settings.py in your Django project, and add these lines:

            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...,
                "corsheaders",
                ...,
            ]

        2) Still in settings.py, add these lines too:

            MIDDLEWARE = [
                ...,
                "corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware",
                "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
                ...,
            ]

            >> CRITICAL: CorsMiddleware should be placed as high as possible, especially before any
                        middleware that can generate responses such as Django's CommonMiddleware or
                        Whitenoise's WhiteNoiseMiddleware. 

        3) Still in settings, these lines for security reasons:

            # CORS > CSRF Integration:
            # A list of origins that are authorized to make cross-site HTTP requests. The origins
            # in this setting will be allowed, and the requesting origin will be echoed back to the
            # client in the access-control-allow-origin header. Defaults to [].
            CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
                "https://read-only.example.com",
                "https://read-and-write.example.com",
                "http://localhost:8000",  # Dev env for Django;
                "http://127.0.0.1:8000",  # Dev env for Django;
                "http://localhost:5173",  # Dev env for Vue/Vite;
                "http://127.0.0.1:5173",  # Dev env for Vue/Vite;
                # Other ones, depending your system...
            ]
            CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
                "https://read-and-write.example.com",
                "http://localhost:8000",  # Dev env for Django;
                "http://127.0.0.1:8000",  # Dev env for Django;
                "http://localhost:5173",  # Dev env for Vue/Vite;
                "http://127.0.0.1:5173",  # Dev env for Vue/Vite;
                # Other ones, depending your system...
            ]
