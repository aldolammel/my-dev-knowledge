DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK:

    Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
    Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:
    
        - The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
        - Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
        - Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
        - Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
        - Extensive documentation, and great community support.
        - Used and trusted by internationally recognised companies including Mozilla, Red Hat, Heroku, and Eventbrite.

            }

            // After that:
            REST_FRAMEWORK = {
                'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (),
                'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
                    'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',

                    REST framework's login and logout views. Add the following to your root urls.py
                    file:

                        urlpatterns = [
                            ...
                            path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls'))
                        ]
