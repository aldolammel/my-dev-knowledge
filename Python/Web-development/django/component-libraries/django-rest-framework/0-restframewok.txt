DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK:

    Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
    Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:
    
        - The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
        - Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
        - Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
        - Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
        - Extensive documentation, and great community support.
        - Used and trusted by internationally recognised companies including Mozilla, Red Hat, Heroku, and Eventbrite.

    1) Install:

        # With PIP:
            $ pip install djangorestframework
        # With UV:
            $ uv add djangorestframework

    2) Integration:

        2.1) Open the core settings.py in your Django project, and add this lines:

            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'rest_framework',
            ]

        2.2) Still in settings.py, add these lines too:

            // In case you are using JWT, it comes first:
            SIMPLE_JWT = {
                #...
            }

            // After that, the Django Rest Framework things:
            REST_FRAMEWORK = {
                'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
                    #... or nothing in.
                ),
                'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
                    # Use Django's standard `django.contrib.auth` permissions, or allow read-only
                    # access for unauthenticated users!

                    #'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
                    'rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly',
                ),
            }

        2.3) If you're intending to use the browsable API you'll probably also want to add REST 
            framework's login and logout views. Add the following to your root urls.py file:

                urlpatterns = [
                    #...
                    path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls'))
                ]

                >> INFO: 
                    Note that the URL path can be whatever you want!

                >> Example:
