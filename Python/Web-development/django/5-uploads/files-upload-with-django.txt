DJANGO: HOW TO UPLOAD FILES


    PRE) Make sure you already did it:
        /Python/python-knowledge/27-Files-basics/files-upload.txt


    1) What way you wanna take for your app file uploading?

        1A) Using basic Django solution;
        1B) xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

        1A) Using basic Django solution:

            PRE) Once the HTML form is available and targeting in your Django app via form action attribute, make sure the first line after the opening <form> tag is:
                
                {% csrf_token %}

            1A.1) Go to the app views.py file and:

                E.g.

                    from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
                    from django.shortcuts import render
                    from django.views import View

                    class CreateProfileView(View):
                        def get(self, request):
                            return render(request, "profiles/create_profile.html")

                        def post(self, request):
                            request.FILES  
                                # This 'request' object has properties like: 
                                # .POST: access to all sent non-file data from form;
                                # .FILES: access to uploaded file (dictionary) from form;
                            return HttpResponseRedirect('/my_subapp_done_page')

            1A.2) Assuming your input file through the form has a name, tell Django which dictionary key it should work with the app uploaded files:
                
                E.g. 
                    request.FILES['image']  # Assuming the input file is named as 'image'!

            1A.3) Still in your_app/views.py file, create a function to handle the uploaded files. So before the view class, choose one way:

                1A3.1) Using Python only;
                1A3.2) Or using Django basic solution;

                - - - - - 

                1A3.1) Using Python only:
                    /Python/python-knowledge/27-Files-basics/1-basic/write-file-img.py
                
                1A3.2) Using Django basic solution:
                    /xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
