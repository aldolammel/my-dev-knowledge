DJANGO > FILES UPLOAD > IMAGE: CUSTOMIZING VALIDATIONS


    FOR YOUR INFORMATION:
        Django already validate file names where, if the another file with the same name, Django renamed the last file. Also, for image, Django controls if the loaded image is a really image. If your solution has a Model defining the image field, Django will validate in back-end level, not just on browser.
