DJANGO: HOW TO UPLOAD IMAGE FILES (PART 1/2)


    PRE.1) Make sure you already got the HTML form ready:
        /Python/python-knowledge/27-Files-basics/files-upload-options.txt


    PRE.2) Prepare the very basic Django config for image upload:
        ./django-upload-image-basic.txt

        TO EDIT: maybe you can delete this old file: 
            /Python/Web-development/django/5-uploads/_basic-images-upload.txt


    1) Once the HTML form is available and targeting in your Django app via form action attribute, make sure the first line after the opening <form> tag is:
                
        {% csrf_token %}


    2) Go to the app views.py file and:

        E.g.

            from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
            from django.shortcuts import render
            from django.views import View

            class CreateProfileView(View):
                def get(self, request):
                    return render(request, "profiles/create_profile.html")

                def post(self, request):
                    request.FILES  
                        # This 'request' object has properties like: 
                        # .POST: access to all sent non-file data from form;
                        # .FILES: access to uploaded file (dictionary) from form;
                    return HttpResponseRedirect('/my_subapp_done_page')


    3) Assuming your input to upload image files through the form has a name, tell Django which dictionary key it should work with the app uploaded files. So in views.py file:
        
        E.g. 
            request.FILES['user_image']  # Assuming the input file is named as 'user_image'!


    4) Still in your_app/views.py file, create a class to handle the uploaded files. So before the view class, choose one way:

        ./django-upload-image-p2.txt

        And now you should close this roadmap here!
