DJANGO: HOW TO UPLOAD IMAGE FILES (IN A MORE CUSTOMIZABLE WAY, PART 1/2)


    PRE.1) Make sure you already got the HTML form ready:
        /Python/python-knowledge/27-Files-basics/files-upload-options.txt


    PRE.2) Prepare the very basic Django config for media upload:
        ./django-upload-image-basic.txt


    1) (if applicable)
        Once the non-admin form is available on the front-end, and it's targeting in your Django app via form action attribute, make sure the first line after the opening <form> tag is:
                
            {% csrf_token %}


    2) Go to the app views.py file and:

        E.g.

            from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
            from django.shortcuts import render
            from django.views import View

            class CreateProfileView(View):
                def get(self, request):
                    return render(request, "profiles/create_profile.html")

                def post(self, request):
                    request.FILES['user_image']  # Assuming the input file on form is named as 'user_image'!
                        # This request-object has properties like: 
                            # .POST: access to all sent non-file data from form;
                            # .FILES: access to uploaded file (dictionary) from form;
                    return HttpResponseRedirect('/my_subapp_done_page')


    3) Go to the app urls.py and add:

            E.g.
                from django.urls import path
                from . import views

                urlpatterns = [
                    path("", views.CreateProfileView.as_view())
                ]
    

    4) Now, follow this roadmap:

        ./django-upload-image-p2.txt
