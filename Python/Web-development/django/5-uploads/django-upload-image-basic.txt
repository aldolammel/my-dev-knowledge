DJANGO: HOW TO UPLOAD IMAGE FILES (BASIC STEPS)


    1) If not ready yet, create the 'media' folder (it's the convension for 'upload' folder), in the Django project's root folder;
            

    2) In your Django core (settings.py), define the MEDIA_ROOT constant path based on your choice in the previous step:

        E.g.
            # Where the files are 'physically' stored on server:
            MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
            
            # Address that Django must use to show files to browser/world (for security reasons):
            MEDIA_URL = 'media/'


    3) Now, in core urls.py file, tell browsers where are the images added dynamically when your project is in development mode. Once the Debug is False, Django automatically manage to ignore the development mode settings.

        from django.conf import settings
        from django.conf.urls.static import static
        #...
        
        # DJANGO BASIC:
        urlpatterns = [
            # CMS:
            ...
            # SUB-APPs, APIs:
            ...
        ]

        # DJANGO > ONLY WHEN DEBUG TRUE:
        # Telling to browsers the media path already protected for security reasons. It must be before front-end stuff!
        urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
        urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
        
        # THIRD-PARTY:
        ...
        
        # FRONTEND:
        ...
    
    
    4) Install the Pillow (needed to use Django models.ImageField):
            
        $ python3 -m pip install Pillow
        or:
        $ uv add pillow
