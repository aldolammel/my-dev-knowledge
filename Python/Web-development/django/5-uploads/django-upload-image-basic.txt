DJANGO: HOW TO UPLOAD IMAGE FILES (BASIC STEPS)


    1) If not ready yet, create the 'media' folder (or another name up to you, like 'uploads'), in the Django project's root folder;
            

    2) In your Django core settings (settings.py), define the MEDIA_ROOT constant path based on your choice in the previous step:

        E.g.
            # Where the files are 'physically' stored on server:
            MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
            
            # Address that Django must use to show files to browser/world (for security reasons):
            MEDIA_URL = 'media/'


    3) Now, in core urls.py file, tell browsers where are the images added dynamically:

        from django.conf import settings
        from django.conf.urls.static import static
        #...
        
        # Right after the urlpatterns array:
        # Telling to browsers the media path already protected for security reasons:
        urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
    
    
    4) Install the Pillow (needed to use Django models.ImageField):
            
        $ python3 -m pip install Pillow
        or:
        $ uv add pillow
