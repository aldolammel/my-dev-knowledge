DJANGO: HOW TO UPLOAD IMAGE FILES (BASIC STEPS)


    1) If not ready yet, create the 'uploads' folder (or another name up to you), for example, in the Django project's root folder;
            

    2) In your Django core settings (settings.py), define the MEDIA_ROOT constant path based on your choice in the previous step:

        E.g.
            MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'uploads'


    3) Install the Pillow (needed to use Django models.ImageField):
            
        $ python3 -m pip install Pillow
        or:
        $ uv add pillow
