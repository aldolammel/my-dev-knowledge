DJANGO: HOW TO UPLOAD IMAGE FILES (SIMPLEST WAY)


    PRE.1) Make sure you already got the HTML form ready:
        /Python/python-knowledge/27-Files-basics/files-upload-options.txt


    PRE.2) Prepare the very basic Django config for image upload:
        ./django-upload-image-basic.txt


    1) In the HTML where is or should be the form, replace entirely the current <form> tag content to:
        
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form }}
        <button>Upload</button>


    2) Go to the app views.py file and create a view class that inherits CreateView's features:
        
        >> CreateView features:
            /Python/Web-development/django/3-2-views-and-API/1-building-views-context/class-based/_views-class-create.txt

        E.g.
            from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView
            from .models import UserProfile

            class CreateProfileView(CreateView):
                template_name = "profiles/create_profile.html"
                model = UserProfile
                fields = "__all__"
                success_url = "/profiles"

            # IMPORTANT: in this way, you don't need any Django custom form in forms.py!


        3) Go to the app urls.py and add:

            E.g.
                from django.urls import path
                from . import views

                urlpatterns = [
                    path("", views.CreateProfileView.as_view())
                ]

EXTRA INFO: CONTEXT PROCESSORS

    If you want to use {{ MEDIA_URL }} in your templates, add 'django.template.context_processors.media' in the 'context_processors' option of TEMPLATES.
