DJANGO STRUCTURE: TEMPLATES


    >> Django is divided in 3 main parts: models, views, and templates.

    >> Templates are responsable for display the data to the user through a text or layout file
        such as an HTML page. All data rendered via templates came from a views.py. Unlike Models
        and Views, template is NOT a specific file but a folder structure and its content basically
        formed by HTML files. Templates are responsible for:

        - Define the presentation layer of your application;
        - Use template tags and filters to render data dynamically;
        - Separate the presentation from the business logic.

        Built-in template tags and filters:
