DJANGO > CMS > WHAT KIND OF FORM DO YOU NEED: "B"

    PRE) What kind of CMS UX do you need: 
        /Python/Web-development/django/4-cms-admin/_what-kind-of-cms-ux-do-you-need.txt

    For new objects, through the adding detail-view, select an option first (using a radio or dropdown menu), and then Django loads the specific form (still in detail-view) based on the previous selection. For existing entries through the list-view, each listed entry, if clicked, loads its specific form based in a specific model (with its unique fields);


        B1) Install the dependency 'PolymorphicModel';
        
        B2) Add 'PolymorphicModel' inheritance to each model class you wanna consider as specific form in CMS;
            E.g.
                class CommonForPeople(PolymorphicModel, models.Model):  # type: ignore[django-manager-missing]  # If MyPy warning it!
                    name = ...
                class OnlyForMale(CommonForPeople):  # CMS reads it as a specific form for men.
                    balls_amount = ...
                class OnlyForFemale(CommonForPeople):  # Same logic here.
                    pms_cases_by_year = ...
        
        B3) On the CMS sidebar menu, let's make visible just the "People list-view" link;

            E.g.
                from polymorphic.admin import (
                    PolymorphicParentModelAdmin,
                    PolymorphicChildModelAdmin,
                )

                @admin.register(models.CommonForPeople)
                class CommonForPeopleAdmin(PolymorphicParentModelAdmin):
                    base_model = models.CommonForPeople
                    child_models = (
                        models.OnlyForMale,    # First on this tuple's treated as the default!
                        models.OnlyForFemale,
                    )
                    list_display = ("name", "slug", "polymorphic_ctype")
                    list_filter = ("polymorphic_ctype",)
                
                @admin.register(models.OnlyForMale)
                class OnlyForMaleAdmin(PolymorphicChildModelAdmin):
                    base_model = models.CommonForPeople
                    show_in_index = False  # If exists in CMS sidebar menu.

                # And so on for all form options...
