TESTING DJANGO INTEGRATION WITH AN EXTERNAL FRONTEND SOLUTION:


    >> DEVELOPMENT MODE:

        Recommended method for development phase of the project. Here is need to run both servers
        separately: Django in a terminal, and the external frontend solution in another.

            # Terminal 1 = Django backend = localhost:8000
                $ python manage.py runserver
                
                or
                
                $ uv run manage.py runserver

            # Terminal 2 = Vue frontend = localhost:5173
                $ cd frontend
                $ npm run dev


    >> Or PRODUCTION-LIKE MODE:

        In this case, it's need to compile the entire project to visualize correctly. 
        Attention for cache issues!

            # Build Vue frontend
                $ cd frontend
                $ npm run build

            # Run Django server
                $ python manage.py runserver
