RELATION: CIRCULAR


    >> Two models that have a circular relationship:

        class Product(models.Model):
            ...
            last_buyer = models.ForeignKey('User')
        
        class User(models.Model):
            ...
            created_products = models.ManyToManyField('Product')

            >> In this example, we have multiple relationships between the same two models.
                Hence we might need to define them in both models. By using the model name as 
                a string instead of a direct reference, Django is able to resolve such dependencies.
