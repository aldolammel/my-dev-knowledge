DJANGO STRUCTURE: MODELS.PY


    >> Django is divided in 3 main parts: models, views, and templates.

    >> Models are responsable for listing the data structure of a Django application, using
        classes to build tables and their attributes in a database. Through models.py you:

        - Define the schema of your database;
        - Provide methods for querying and manipulating the data;
        - Enforce data integrity by defining constraints and validations.
