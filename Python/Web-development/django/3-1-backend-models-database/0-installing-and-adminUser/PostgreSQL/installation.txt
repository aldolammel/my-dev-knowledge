DATABASE ON DJANGO: POSTGRESQL


    1) Install the PostgreSQL Python module:
        https://www.psycopg.org/


    2) If the database won't be in the cloud, install the PostgreSQL locally:
        /Database/PostgreSQL/0-installing-and-updating/postgres-installing.txt

    
    3) In core folder, open the settings.py file:

        >> Option 1:
            Only lines for db configuration, specificaly for POSTGRESQL:
                /Python/Web-development/django/3-1-backend-models-database/0-installing-and-adminUser/PostgreSQL/settings.py
        
        >> Option 2:
            An entire settings.py template:
                /Python/Web-development/django/z-project-examples/proj-aldolammel-style/core/settings.py

    
    4) Make a copy of '.env' file to the project root folder:
        
        /Environment-Variables/


    5) If you see the file sqlite.db in the project root folder, delete it, once you are using PostgreSQL;


    6) If you are installing a new Django project or re-installing a new database, return to the previously installation checklist because other steps are needed before to migrate command. 
    
    Otherwise, if it's not the case, in a new Terminal window, select the virtual environment again and give the order to build the database, finally:
        
        $ python manage.py makemigrations
        $ python manage.py migrate
        
        or

        $ uv run manage.py makemigrations
        $ uv run manage.py migrate
