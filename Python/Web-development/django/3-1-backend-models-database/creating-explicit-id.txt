CREATING AN EXPLICIT ID/PK:


    >> In Django, primary keys are created automatically:
        
        /Python/Web-development/django/3-1-backend-models-database/field-id.txt


    >> But you can force it if needed:

        E.g.

            class Movie(models.Model):
                id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)  # 'id' arg/param can be customized too!

    
    
    SmallAutoField ............ guaranteed to fit numbers from 1 to 32767.

    AutoField ................. guaranteed to fit numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

    BigAutoField .............. guaranteed to fit numbers from 1 to 9223372036854775807.
    
    UUIDField ................. Faster and more secure, but the db won't generate it for you,
                                so it's recommended to use default:

                                    # In models.py:
                                    import uuid

                                    # In the model-class:
                                    id = models.UUIDField(
                                        primary_key=True, 
                                        default=uuid.uuid4, 
                                        editable=False
                                    )
