MODEL FIELD: ID


    >> by default, Django will create a field called 'id' for you (so when you create a model class, you don't need to declare it), which is the primary key.

        >> In settings.py, you can define the default auto field:
            
            # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/settings/#default-auto-field
            DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.AutoField'


    >> For explicitly create a field called 'id', you can use:
