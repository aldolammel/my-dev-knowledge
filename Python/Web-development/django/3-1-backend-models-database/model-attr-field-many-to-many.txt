DJANGO MODEL CLASS > ATTRIBUTE TYPE: MANY-TO-MANY FIELD

    Common Usage:
        Defining a many-to-many relationship between two models. This requires Django to create a separate "junction" or "through" table in the database.

    Field look-like on front-end:
        xxxxxxx

    Example:
        
        categories = models.ManyToManyField(
            "PagexCategory",
            blank=True,
            related_name="pagex_categories",
        )

        # On an Article model (an article can have many tags, and a tag can be on many articles):
        tags = models.ManyToManyField(Tag)

        # On a Course model (a student can take many courses, and a course can have many students):
        students = models.ManyToManyField(Student)
