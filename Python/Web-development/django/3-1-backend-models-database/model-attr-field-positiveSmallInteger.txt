DJANGO MODEL CLASS > ATTRIBUTE TYPE: POSITIVE SMALL INTEGER FIELD

    Typical Size:
        2 bytes (16-bit)

    Signed Range:
        0 to 32,767 (It uses the same 2-byte storage as SmallIntegerField but restricts values to positive numbers and zero, enforced by Django).

    Common usage:
        The ideal choice for storing small, non-negative integers where saving space is a priority. Perfect for fields with a known, limited positive range like human age, quantity in stock, days until expiration, seats in a theather.

    Example:

        pos_on_menu = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(
            default=0,
        )
