USERS SETUP:


    >> SIMPLEST:
    If you need just user registration for the CMS/ADMIN only, without the necessity of profile pages on the application front-end, so use this simplest default solution:
        
        /Python/Web-development/django/3-1-backend-models-database/3-users/1-basic-users-only-for-cms.txt
    

    >> EXTENDING USER POSSIBILITIES:
    If your project needs to show User Profile on the application front-end, or even a simple user creation form also on the application front-end, you must use these settings!
