DJANGO > TYPE CHECKER: DJANGO STUBS


    It's a package contains type stubs and a custom mypy plugin to provide more precise static types
    and type inference for Django framework. Django uses some Python "magic" that makes having
    precise types for some code patterns problematic. This is why we need this project. The final
    goal is to be able to get precise types for most common patterns.
