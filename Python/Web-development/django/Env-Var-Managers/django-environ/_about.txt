ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE MANAGER: DJANGO-ENVIRON

    To seamlessly integrate environment-based configuration with the Django framework. It builds
    upon the ideas of python-dotenv but adds Django-specific features, type casting, and URL
    parsing that are indispensable for Django projects.


    Examples (Do not use them):
        
        1) Defining the back-end environment variables:
            /Python/Web-development/django/Env-Var-Managers/django-environ/examples/.env
        
        2) Calling those env vars in Django settings:
            /Python/Web-development/django/Env-Var-Managers/django-environ/examples/settings.py


    >> Installation:

        1) Include the manager as a mandatory project's dependency:
        
            >> Using UV:
                $ uv add django-environ
            
            >> Or using PIP:
                $ pip install django-environ


    >> Integration:

        1) (If applicable)
            Make sure .gitignore file is ignoring or not the .env file;
