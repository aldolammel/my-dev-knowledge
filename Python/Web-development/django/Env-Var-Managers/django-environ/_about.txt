ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE MANAGER: DJANGO-ENVIRON

    To seamlessly integrate environment-based configuration with the Django framework. It builds
    upon the ideas of python-dotenv but adds Django-specific features, type casting, and URL
    parsing that are indispensable for Django projects.


    Examples (Do not use then):
        /Python/Web-development/django/Env-Var-Managers/django-environ/examples/.env
        /Python/Web-development/django/Env-Var-Managers/django-environ/examples/settings.py
