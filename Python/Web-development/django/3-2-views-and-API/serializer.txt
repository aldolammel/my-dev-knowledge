        PRE.1) Database structure:
            Assuming you have your Django project running with its database.


        PRE.2) Toolkit:
            Assuming you have already an Web API toolkit like Django REST Framework.
                
                /Python/Web-development/django/component-libraries/django-rest-framework/0-restframewok.txt     
        

        1) Data conversion (my_app/serializers.py):
            Creating a Serializer-class (API) attached with the Model-class where the data belongs.
                ./_serializer-class-model.py


        2) API logic:
            
            >> Sending data (my_app/views.py)::
                Declaring which serialized data must be released externally.
                    ./serializer-view-sending-data.py

            >> Or Sending/Receiving data:
                xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
                    /xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        

        3) URL routing (my_app/urls.py):
            Direct the incoming web requests, pointing them to the right Views.py class.
                
                ./serializer-urls.py


        4) Visualization on CMS (my_app/admin.py):
            ./serializer-admin-json-preview.py
        
        
        5) Test it!
