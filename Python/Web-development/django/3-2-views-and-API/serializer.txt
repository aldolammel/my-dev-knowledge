        PRE.1) Database structure:
            Assuming you have your Django project running with its database.


        PRE.2) Toolkit:
            Assuming you have already an Web API toolkit like Django REST Framework.
                
                /Python/Web-development/django/component-libraries/django-rest-framework/0-restframewok.txt     
        

        1) Data conversion:
            Creating a Serializer-class (API) attached with the Model-class where the data belongs.
            
                /Python/Web-development/django/3-2-views-and-API/serializer-creating-class.py


        2) API logic:
            
            >> Sending data:
                Declaring which serialized data must be released externally.
                    /Python/Web-development/django/3-2-views-and-API/serializer-view-sending-data.py

            >> Or Sending/Receiving data:
                xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
                    /xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        

        3) URL routing:
            Direct the incoming web requests, pointing them to the right Views.py class.
                
                /Python/Web-development/django/3-2-views-and-API/serializer-urls.py
