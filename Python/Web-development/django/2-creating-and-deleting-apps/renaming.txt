DJANGO SUB-APPS: RENAMING AN EXISTENT APP

    soon...

    Important: 'namespace' that you see in /yourapp/urls.py has not the same scope of 'name' in 
                /yourapp/apps.py. The 'namespace' is only used for that urls.py file meanwhile the
                'name' is the true sub-app name for Django.
