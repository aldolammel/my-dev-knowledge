    QUERYSETS FOR FORMS: FILTERING A DROPDOWN

    >> There's a database with a list of many vehicle from different brands. Each brand-seller
        (user) is able to select vehicles already sold. Of course the brand-seller sells vehicles
        of a specific brand. That said, your form should prevent the Ford seller to pick
        a Fiat vehicle, right?
        
            So, how does filter only the Ford vehicles from a database table with many other brands?
    
            Let's go!

    >> What are QuerySets?
