        >> Basic:
            /Python/Web-development/django/6-validations/1-validation-basic.txt


        >> (WIP !!!!!!!!!) Model argument 'error_messages={}' (server-side checking):

            It's the most reliable and solid way to ensure that anything that causes an infraction 
            for a given attribute will generate the planned error message. However, this method is 
            server-side, that is, it's handled by the server and not by the client machine.

                <example here> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


        >> Error messages on App and CMS front-end (client-side checking):

            It's a great way to validate fields without consuming server resources.
