DJANGO: WHAT IS IT?

    >> Django is a free and open-source, Python-based web framework that runs on a web server.
        It follows the model–template–views (MTV) architectural pattern. It is maintained by the
        Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established in the US. 
        Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites.
        The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code,
        low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself (DRY).
        
        Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models.
        Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface
        that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.

    >> Django is divided in 3 main parts: models, views, and templates.

        >> Models are responsable for listing the data structure of a Django application, using
            classes to build tables and their attributes in a database.

        >> Views are responsable for manage what data the user will see through a template. 
        
        >> Templates are responsable for display the data to the user through a text or layout file
            such as an HTML page.
