    >> Handles redirects. It can redirect to a given URL or dynamically compute the URL based

        form submission or for legacy URL support.

        from django.views.generic.base import RedirectView
        
        class GoToGoogleView(RedirectView):  # This 'View' in classname is a convention.
            url = 'https://google.com/'
