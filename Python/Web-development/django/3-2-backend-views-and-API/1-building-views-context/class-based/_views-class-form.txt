VIEWS CLASSES: USING FORM-VIEW INHERIT:

    >> With a form view inherit, you are able to work better with class-based views
        from forms.py file.
        
        E.g.

            from django.views.generic.edit import FormView
            
            class MyFormTestView(FormView):  # This 'View' in classname is a convention.
                pass
