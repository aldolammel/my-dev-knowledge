DJANGO MODEL CLASS > ATTRIBUTE TYPE: DURATION FIELD

    Common Usage:
        Storing periods of time, represented in Python as a datetime.timedelta object. The underlying database storage is different for each database (e.g., an INTERVAL in PostgreSQL, a BIGINT of microseconds in SQLite). Perfect for the length of a video or audio track; the total time spent on a task or project; the time difference between two events.

    Field look-like on front-end:
        - Single field with a time value (originally in microseconds)*
        - Only the value

    Example:
        
        duration = models.DurationField()  # *

        (*) datetime.timedelta object is powerfull. It represents the duration value can be easily extracted and formated into any unit you want (days, hours, seconds).
