DJANGO MODEL CLASS > ATTRIBUTE TYPE: AUTO FIELD

    This is a subclass of IntegerField specifically designed for primary keys. It automatically increments each time a new object is created, just like the standard BigAutoField, but with the short range of an INTEGER.

    Typical Size:
        4 bytes (like IntegerField)

    Signed Range:
        1 to 2,147,483,647 (Effectively, as it's usually a primary key starting at 1)

    Common usage:
        Automatically incrementing primary keys. You don't define the value; Django automatically assigns the next available number upon object creation. BigAutoField is the default in modern Django to avoid the table size limit of AutoField.

    Example:
        id = models.AutoField(
            primary_key=True,
            unique=True,
            editable=False,
        )
