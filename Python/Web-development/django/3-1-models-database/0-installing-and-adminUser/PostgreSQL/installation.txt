DATABASE ON DJANGO: POSTGRESQL

    Summary:
        1) Installing the database;
        2) Integrating database and back-end;
        3) Creating the database;

    Let's go:

    
    1) Installing the database: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

        >> If the database won't be in the cloud, install the PostgreSQL locally:
            /Database/PostgreSQL/0-installing-and-updating/postgres-installing.txt
        

    2) Integrating database and back-end: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        2.1) Install a Python lib for PostgreSQL:
            https://www.psycopg.org
        
        2.2) In core folder, open the settings.py file:

            >> Option 1:
                Only lines for db configuration, specifically for POSTGRESQL:
                    /Python/Web-development/django/3-1-models-database/0-installing-and-adminUser/PostgreSQL/settings.py
            
            >> Option 2:
                An entire settings.py template:
                    /Python/Web-development/django/z-project-examples/proj-aldolammel-style/core/settings.py
        
        2.3) (If applicable)
            Make a copy of the '.env' file to your project root folder:
                /Environment-Variables/

        2.4) If you see the file sqlite.db in the project root folder, delete it once you are using PostgreSQL and you have no data from this project in that SQLite.


    3) Creating the database: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
        
        ATTENTION:
            If you are installing a new Django project, return to the previously installation roadmap because other steps are needed before to migrate command.
        
        Otherwise, if you have already a Django project built, in a new Terminal window, select the virtual environment again and give the order to build the database, finally:
            
            $ python manage.py makemigrations
            $ python manage.py migrate
            
            or

            $ uv run manage.py makemigrations
            $ uv run manage.py migrate
