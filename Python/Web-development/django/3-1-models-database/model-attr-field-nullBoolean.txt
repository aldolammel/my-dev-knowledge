DJANGO MODEL CLASS > ATTRIBUTE TYPE: NULL BOOLEAN FIELD (DEPRECATED!)

    Deprecated:
        As of Django 3.1, NullBooleanField is deprecated. Its usage should be replaced with BooleanField with the appropriate null=True setting. It remains in the documentation for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future release.
    
    Common Usage:
        It was used to represent a boolean field that needed a "unknown" or "not set" state in addition to True/False. This required three states: True, False, and NULL (in the database) / None (in Python).

    Field look-like on front-end:
        xxxxxxx

    Example:
        
        legacy_field = models.NullBooleanField()  # It should be replaced by BooleanField(null=True, blank=True)
