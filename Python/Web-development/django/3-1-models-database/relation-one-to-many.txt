RELATION: ONE TO MANY (FOREIGN KEY)

    >> Meanwhile an author has one or more books, a book usually has only one author.
        Here we got a perfect example of one-to-many releationship.


    1) Building up both needed classes for our example in models.py file, remembering
        in this case we use 'ForeignKey' model:

        class Author(models.Model):
            name = ...

        class Book(models.Model):
            title = ...
            author = models.ForeignKey(
                Author, 
                related_name='books', 
                on_delete=models.CASCADE,    # .PROTECT  or  .SET_NULL   or   .CASCADE
                null=True,
            )


            MORE ABOUT ON_DELETE:

    2) Still in the same sub-app, in admin.py file:

        from .models import Author, Book

        admin.site.register(Author)
        admin.site.register(Book)

    
    3) Run the CMS and check the if everything is fine.
