IMPORTING USERS

    You want to connect all authenticated users from your app in another table:

    1) In app models.py, import the django User table, and build up the new table
        with the attribute that connect with your users:
            
            from django.conf import settings as stgs
            
            Class Team(models.Model):
                name = models.CharField(max_length=40)
                users = models.ManyToMany(stgs.AUTH_USER_MODEL)

    2) In app admin.py, import the Team class created recently, and register this in
        the CMS:
        
            from .models import Team
            admin.site.register(Team)

    
    3) Execute the 'makemigrations' in the specific app and check the CMS to see the result.
