DJANGO MODEL CLASS > ATTRIBUTE TYPE: BIG AUTO FIELD

    This is a subclass of BigIntegerField specifically designed for primary keys. It automatically increments each time a new object is created, just like the standard AutoField, but with the large range of a BIGINT.

    Typical Size:
        8 bytes (like BigIntegerField)

    Signed Range:
        1 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

    Common usage:
        Automatically incrementing primary keys. You don't define the value; Django automatically assigns the next available number upon object creation. BigAutoField is the default in modern Django to avoid the table size limit of AutoField.

    Example:
        xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
