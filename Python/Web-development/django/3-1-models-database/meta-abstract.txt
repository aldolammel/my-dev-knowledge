DJANGO MODEL > META CLASS: ABSTRACT

    Marks a model as a base class for inheritance, not a database table.

        >> When to use:
            - To create reusable model components/mixins;
            - For shared fields or methods across multiple models;
            - To implement design patterns (like BaseModel with common fields);
            - The abstract model itself doesn't get a database table.

        E.g.
            class AuditBase(models.Model):
                """Stores who and when things were changed."""

                created_at = models.DateTimeField(
                    auto_now_add=True,
                    verbose_name="Instalado em",
                )
                updated_at = models.DateTimeField(
                    auto_now=True,
                    verbose_name="Atualizado em",
                )
                updated_by = models.ForeignKey(
                    stgs.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
                    editable=False,
                    related_name="%(app_label)s_%(class)s_updated_by",
                    on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
                    null=True,
                    verbose_name="Atualizado por",
                )

                class Meta:
                    abstract = True  # Flags the db to don't create this table!

                # AWARE!
                # In this example above, those classes that inherited this class must send the user via admin.py save_model() method!

        
        >> When you CANNOT use abstract:

            You cannot use an abstract model directly in a ForeignKey or ManyToManyField, even with a 'through=' model. Django's ORM simply doesn't allow it 'cause abstract models are not installed in the database, so there's no concrete table to point to.

                >> Possible solution > Concrete Model:
                    ./model-type-concrete.py
