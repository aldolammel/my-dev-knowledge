MYPY TYPE-CHECKER: INSTALLATION AND INTEGRATION

    >> Installing:
        
        1) In the project folder (back-end), install the MyPy as development dependency:

            # Using UV:
                $ uv add --optional dev mypy
            # Using PIP:
                $ pip install mypy
                # Include manually the dev dependency in the project pyproject.toml file:
                    [project.optional-dependencies]
                    dev = [
                        ...
                        "mypy>=1.17.1",
                    ]

        2) In your IDE, install the 'MyPy Type Checker' extension (by Microsoft);

        3) (If applicable / Optional)
            For Django projects, install the django-stubs for better Django type hints!
            (We will see this in Integration steps!)
    

    >> Integration:

        PRE) You already got the pyproject.toml in your project:
            /Python/Web-development/pyproject.toml


        1) Include these lines in your pyproject.toml:
            /Python/Linter-Formatter-Typechecker/mypy/pyproject.toml

        
            1.1) (If applicable / Optional)
                For Django projects, install the django-stubs for better Django type hints:
                    /Python/Web-development/django/Linter-Formatter-Typechecker/django-stubs/installation.txt


        2) (If applicable / Optional)
            In the project .vscode/settings.json, do it:

                PRE) Assuming you have this file in the project:
                    /Python/IDE-softwares/vscode/examples/settings.json

                2.1) Turn off the Pylance Type Checking, leaving this task only to MyPy:
                    
                    // PYTHON SETTINGS
                    ...
                    "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off", // This project is using MyPy for Type Checking.

                2.2) (Optional)
                    Still in .vscode/settings.json, add this:

                        // FILES
                        "files.exclude": {
                            ...
                            "**/.mypy_cache": true,
                        },
                        "search.exclude": {
                            ...
                            "**/.mypy_cache": true,
                        }
