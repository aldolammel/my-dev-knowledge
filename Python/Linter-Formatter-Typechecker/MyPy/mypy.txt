PYTHON LANGUAGE > TYPE CHECKER: MYPY


    By Microsoft, it's an optional static type checker for Python that aims to combine the benefits 
    of dynamic (or "duck") typing and static typing. Mypy combines the expressive power and
    convenience of Python with a powerful type system and compile-time type checking.

    >> Installing:
        
        1) In the project folder (back-end), install the MyPy as development dependency:

            # Using UV:
                $ uv add --optional dev mypy
            # Using PIP:
                $ pip install mypy
                # Include manually the dev dependency in the project pyproject.toml file:
                    [project.optional-dependencies]
                    dev = [
                        ...
                        "mypy>=1.17.1",
                    ]

        2) In your IDE, install the 'MyPy Type Checker' extension (by Microsoft);

        3) (If applicable / Optional) Install the django-stubs for better Django type hints:
            /Python/Linter-Formatter-Typechecker/django-stubs.txt
    

    >> Integration:

        PRE) You already got the pyproject.toml in your project:
            /Python/Web-development/pyproject.toml


        1) Include these lines in your pyproject.toml:
            /Python/Linter-Formatter-Typechecker/mypy/pyproject.toml


        2) (If applicable / Optional) In the project .vscode/settings.json, turn off The
                        Pylance Type Checking, leaving this task only to MyPy:

                        PRE) Assuming you have this file in the project:
                            /Python/IDE-softwares/vscode/examples/settings.json

                        2.1) Add lines:
                            // PYTHON SETTINGS
                            "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off", // This project is using MyPy for Type Checking.
