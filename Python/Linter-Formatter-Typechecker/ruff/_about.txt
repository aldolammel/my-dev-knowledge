PYTHON LANGUAGE > LINTER AND FORMATTER: RUFF


    Ruff is a high-performance linter and code formatter for Python, developed by Astral. It's 
    notable for its exceptional speed, largely attributed to being written in Rust. 

    Checks: Python syntax errors, import sorting, code style (PEP 8), bugs, complexity, etc.

    Tip: Ruff is developed by the same company of the UV Package manager, so both are completely
        integrated.

    >> HOW TO FIX CODE FORMATTING:
        $ uv run ruff format                      # Format all files in Django-project-folder **.
        $ uv run ruff format path/to/code/        # Format all files in `path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
        $ uv run ruff format path/to/file.py      # Format a single file.

        (**) Except those files in folders like .venv/, dist/, build/, .vscode/, .git/, etc...
