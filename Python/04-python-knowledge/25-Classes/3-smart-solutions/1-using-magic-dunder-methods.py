CLASSES: USING MAGIC / 'DUNDER' METHODS

Dunder methods, short for "double underscore methods," are special methods in Python that have double
underscores at the beginning and end of their names. They are also known as "magic methods" or "special methods."
These methods are predefined by the Python language and allow you to customize the behavior of your objects
for built-in operations such as arithmetic operations, comparisons, and type conversions.

For example:

    __init__(self, ...)
    The initializer method, called when an instance of the class is created.
    It initializes the object's attributes.

    __str__(self)
    Defines the human-readable string representation of an object, used by print() and str().

    __repr__(self)
    Provides an unambiguous string representation of an object, useful for debugging.

    __len__(self)
   Returns the length of the object.

    __getitem__(self, key)
    Allows indexing and slicing of the object.

    __setitem__(self, key, value)
    Allows item assignment: obj[key] = value.

    And much more others:
        __contains__(self, item)
        __add__(self, other)
        __sub__(self, other)
        __eq__(self, other)
        __lt__(self, other)
        __delitem__(self, key)
        __iter__(self)
        __next__(self)
        __call__(self, *args, **kwargs)
        __enter__(self)
        __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)
