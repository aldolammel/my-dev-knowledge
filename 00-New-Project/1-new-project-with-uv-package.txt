UV PACKAGE

    >> Extremely fast Python package installer and resolver designed as a drop-in replacement for
        pip and pip-tools workflows.

    >> When you ask to UV to initiate a project, a "uv.lock" file is created automatically,
        garanteeing that all copies of this project will have the same dependencies (like a Docker).

    >> If you lose your virtual environment folder, you can recreate the venv using "uv sync"
        command to re-install the project dependencies fast and easily.
