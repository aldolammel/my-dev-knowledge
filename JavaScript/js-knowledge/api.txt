API SOLUTION: FETCH API (JS native solution)

    For simple needs, this is the best option for sure. It has matured significantly and is a
    completely viable option:

        - Native to browsers (no extra dependencies)
        - Promise-based
        - Modern and well-supported
        - Lighter weight than Axios

    
        E.g.
            /JavaScript/Web-development/frontend/z-examples/fetch-api/
