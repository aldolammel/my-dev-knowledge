LINTER: ESLINT

    ESLint is a static code analysis tool for JavaScript. Its primary purpose is to find and fix
    problems in your code. It doesn't run your code; instead, it scans your source files and flags
    issues based on a set of predefined rules.

    Checks: finds errors and enforces style rules.

>> Just run your app normally that ESLint checks your files:
    
    >> Using NPM + VITE:
        $ npm run dev
    
    >> Or using NPM + Vue-CLI:
        $ npm run serve


>> Check for warnings and errors manually:

    # Just list issues:
        $ npm run lint:check
    # List and fix them:
        $ npm run lint
