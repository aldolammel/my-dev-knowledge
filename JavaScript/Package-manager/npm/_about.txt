NODE.JS: NPM, NODE PACKAGE MANAGER

    It's the default package manager for Node.js and serves two main purposes:

        1. Command-line tool that lets you:

            - Install JavaScript packages/libraries for your projects
            - Manage project dependencies
            - Run scripts defined in your project
            - Publish your own packages to share with others

        2. Online registry (npmjs.com) - a massive repository of open-source JavaScript packages that developers can use in their projects.
