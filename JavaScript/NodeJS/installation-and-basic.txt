    1) Install Node.js and its basic tools:

        >> Windows:
            https://nodejs.org

        
        >> Mac: 
            https://nodejs.org


        >> Ubuntu:

            # Update the package list:
                $ sudo apt update

            # (Optional) Uninstall Node.js:
                /JavaScript/NodeJS/uninstall-node.txt

            # Install Node.js and its tools:
                
                # Option 1/2: globally, no matter where you are on Terminal (NOT recommended):
                    
                    # Important: if you prefer or is planning to use the NVM (Node Version Manager),
                                you should take the 'Option 2/2' path, skipping the entire option-1;
                    
                    # Installing Node.JS globally with its NPM (Node-Package-Manager) together:
                        $ sudo apt install nodejs npm

                
                # Option 2/2: just for current user, no matter where you are on Terminal (BEST approach for multiple-projects):

                    # CRUCIAL: Node.js with NVM is NOT installed by project but user, actually.
                                The user/you can define which installed Node.JS version should run
                                for each project folder (you'll see it further).
                    
                    # Check if you already got the NVM and NPM:
                        $ nvm -v      <-- Node Version Manager
                        $ npm -v      <-- Node Package Manager (it's embeded with NVM)

                        # If you didn't take the NVM last version, install/update (bringing Node.JS and NPM together automatically):
                            # Make sure in https://nodejs.org you are getting the last NVM version:
                                $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

                            # Close and re-open the terminal or restart the shell with this:
                                $ \. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"

                    # Check all NodeJS versions your user has installed through NVM (you can switch
                        among them easily):
                            $ nvm list

                            # Important: 
                                That's why "node -v" is NOT recommended to check the NodeJS version.

                        # If you already have the version you want, select it:
                            
                            # Option 1/2 - a specific installed version:
                                $ nvm use <version>
                            
                            # Option 2/2 - the most recent LTS (Long Term Support) version already
                                installed:
                                    $ nvm use --lts
                    
                        # Or install other version(s) you need:

                            # Installing:
                            
                                # Option 1/2 - a specific version to install:
                                    $ nvm install 24    <-- this number will take latest version of XX (eg. 24.4.1)
                                    
                                # Option 2/2 - the most recent LTS (Long Term Support) version to install:
                                    $ nvm install --lts

                            # Selecting the right version for each project (no matter where you are on terminal):
                                $ nvm use <version>

                            # IMPORTANT about Node Version Switching automazition:
                                /JavaScript/NodeJS/nvm-switch-node-version-automatically.txt
                        
                        # Check the current selected NodeJS version for the project:
                            $ nvm current


        
    2) (Optional) Installing/Uninstalling Node.js packages/components you need for your project:
        /JavaScript/NodeJS/npm-knowledge.txt
        

        
    3) (Optional) Make sure you got the .gitignore updated:
        /JavaScript/NodeJS/node-gitignore.txt
