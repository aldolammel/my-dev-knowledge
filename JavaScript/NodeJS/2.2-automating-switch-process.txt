NODE > NVM: AUTOMATING THE SWITCH PROCESS BY PROJECT

    
    PRE) Assuming you already got the NVM (default Node Version Manager) installed:
        ./1-installation.txt

    
    >> Choose what automation you wish:

        A) Semi-automatic, using .nvmrc file on each project folder (Faster, most common);
        B) Absolutelly automatic, editing the ~/.bashrc (Advanced);

        - - - - - - 

        A) Semi-automatic, using .nvmrc file - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

            A.1) Go to the project folder root:
                            
                # Option 1/2 - a specific installed version:
                    $ echo "<version>" > .nvmrc      <-- E.g. you can set like "22" or exact "22.17.1" that is a LTS version.
                
                # Option 2/2 - the most recent LTS (Long Term Support) version already installed:
                    # It's confusing coz it demands the LTS-code-name to works (Not recommended here)!

                # To edit that file (if needed):
                    $ nano .nvmrc

            A.2) Now, always you get in the project folder, run this to automatically select the right
                Node.JS version:
                    $ nvm use
            


        B) Absolutelly automatic, editing the ~/.bashrc - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
        
            B.1) ...
