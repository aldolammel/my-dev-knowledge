        >> Ubuntu:

            # Locally (Strongly recommended):
                
                # In the project folder, check the current packages are installed on this project:
                    $ npm list
                
                # So, again, in the project folder, install the desired package/component:
                    $ npm install <package_name>

            
            # Globally:

                # In your user root folder, check the current packages are installed on this machine:
                    $ npm list
                
                # No matter where you are, install the desired package/component globally (-g):
                    $ npm install -g <package_name>



    >> Uninstall a Node package/component:


            # Locally:

                    $ npm list
                
                # So, again, in the project folder, uninstall the desired package/component:
