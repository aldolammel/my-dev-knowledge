NODE.JS: UPDATING

    
    REMEMBER:
        When you install the NVM, it brings the Node.js and, by consequence, the NPM (the embedded Node Package Manager).

    WHAT TO UPDATE:
        If you wanna update Node, NPM, and NVM, keep going in this checklist. Otherwise, skip this and visit this one:
            ./3.1-updating-compoenent.txt
        
        
    PRE) Node installed:
        ./1-installation.txt

    
    1) Update the Ubunto package list:
        $ sudo apt update
        $ sudo apt upgrade


    2) Checking current versions for the current user:

        IMPORTANT:
            Node.js with NVM is NOT installed by project but user. The user/you can define which installed Node.JS version should run for each project folder.


        $ nvm -v                           <-- Node Version Manager
        $ nvm list node                    <-- If already available, best way to check Node version!
        $ npm -v                           <-- Node Package Manager (it's embedded with NVM)



    3) Update (switching to or including the latest version):
        ./2.1-switch-versions.txt
