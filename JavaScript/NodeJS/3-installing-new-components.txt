NODE.JS: INSTALLING NEW NODE COMPONENTS

    REMEMBER:
        Unlike NVM, the NPM is watching the folder you are running the terminal!

    
    PRE) Assuming you got NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. Otherwise:
        ./1-installation.txt


    1) Installing a new component:

        A) Globally;
        B) Locally (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED);

            # So, again, in the project folder, install the desired package/component:
                $ npm install <package_name>

            # No matter where you are, install the desired package/component globally (-g):
                $ npm install -g <package_name>
