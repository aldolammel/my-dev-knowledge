API SOLUTION: AXIOS

    Axios is a popular HTTP client library for Node.js (and browsers) that simplifies making
    HTTP requests. So Axios provides a promise-based interface for making HTTP requests, offering
    a cleaner and more feature-rich alternative to Node.js's built-in http module or
    the browser's fetch() API.

        About: https://axios-http.com/

    >> Its strengths include:

        - Automatic JSON transformation
        - Request/response interceptors
        - Better error handling than Fetch
        - Browser and Node.js support
        - Request cancellation
        - Built-in CSRF protection

        >> KEY FEATURES EXAMPLES:
            >> Request Methods: Supports all standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,
                PATCH, etc.) with simple method calls:

                    // GET request
                    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/users');

                    // POST request with data
                    const response = await axios.post('https://api.example.com/users', {
                        name: 'John Doe',
                        email: 'john@example.com'
                    });

            >> Request/Response Interceptors: Allows you to transform requests or responses before
                they're handled:

                    // Add auth token to all requests
                    axios.interceptors.request.use(config => {
                        config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
                        return config;
                    });


    >> Installing Axios:

        # On project front-end folder:
            $ npm install axios 
            
        # If vulnerability:
            $ npm audit fix
