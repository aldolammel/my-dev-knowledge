NODE.JS:

    Node.js is a runtime and open-source JavaScript environment that allows you to run JS code on the server side. This enables JS to be used for building fast, scalable server-side apps. That said, Node.js is a cross-platform that can be ran through all wide-known OS's, executing JS code outside a browser.
    
    It's predominantly used for backend development but also plays a significant role in frontend development, including non-web-development projects like Game, LoT, and other types of Softwares.
