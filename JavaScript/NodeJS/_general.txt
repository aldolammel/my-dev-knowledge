NODE.JS:

    >> Node.js is a runtime and open-source JavaScript environment that allows you to run JS code on
        the server side. This enables JS to be used for building fast, scalable server-side apps. 
        That said, Node.js is a cross-platform that can be ran through all wide-known OS's,
        executing JS code outside a browser.
    
        It's predominantly used for backend development but also plays a significant role in frontend
        development, including non-web-development projects like Game, LoT, and other types of 
        Softwares.
