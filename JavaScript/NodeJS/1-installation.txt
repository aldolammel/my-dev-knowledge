NODE.JS: INSTALLATION


    PRE) What is it:
        ./_about.txt


    1) Installing Node:

        >> Check if you already got Node installed:
            # Locally:
                $ node -v
                    # If you already have it, leave this roadmap through this one:
                        ./2-updating.txt

            # Globally:
                $ which nodejs
                    # If this returned something, it extremelly advised to uninstall it:
                        ./uninstall.txt

        >> Installation approach:
            
            A) Globally, WITHOUT the any version manager (NOT recommended);
            B) By project, using NVM as Node version manager;
            C) By project, using Docker instead of NVM;

            - - - - - 

            A) Globally, WITHOUT the NVM (NOT recommended) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                
                >> To think:
                    If you prefer or is planning to use the NVM (Node Version Manager), you should take the 'B' path, skipping the entire 'A';
                
                >> Installing globally:
                    No matter where you are in Terminal, installing Node.JS and its NPM (Node Package Manager):
                        $ sudo apt install nodejs npm

                >> Make sure Node is installed globally:
                    $ which nodejs                      <-- It nothing returns, something got wrong!

            
            B) By project, using NVM - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

                CRUCIAL:
                    Node.js with NVM is NOT installed by project but user. You can define which installed Node.JS version should run for each project folder (you'll see it further).

                B.1) Make sure Node is NOT installed globally:
                    $ which nodejs                 <-- if nothing returns, Node is NOT global! Good!
                        # Otherwise, if it returned something, uninstall Node:
                            ./4-uninstall.txt
                
                B.2) Installing NVM (it brings Node + NPM):
                
                    RECOMMENDED:
                        Check if the installation steps below keeps true:
                            https://nodejs.org
                            
                    B.2.1) Download and install NVM:
                        $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

                    B.2.2) In lieu of restarting the shell
                        $ \. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
                    
                    B.2.3) Download and install Node.js (it brings the NPM):
                        $ nvm install 24
                    
                    B.2.4) Verify versions:
                        $ node -v
                        $ npm -v

                        # If Node version is not what you want, no worries, keep going!

                    B.2.5) Define which version you wanna work:
                        ./2.1-switch-versions.txt


            C) By project, using Docker instead of NVM as node version manager - - - - - - - - - - -

    2) (Optional)
        Make sure you got the .gitignore updated:
            ./node-gitignore.txt
        

    3) Installing Node packages/components for your project:
        ./3-installing-new-components.txt
