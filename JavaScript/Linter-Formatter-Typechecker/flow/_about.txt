TYPESCRIPT TYPE CHECKER: FLOW

    The most powerful and rigorous alternative to TypeScript.

    How it works: You add type annotations via special comment syntax (// @flow) and JSDoc-like type
    comments. It requires a dedicated build step to strip these out for production.

    Pros:

        Very strong, sound type system. Catches a wide range of errors.

        Excellent editor support (via a dedicated VSCode extension).

        Gradual adoption: you can add // @flow to one file at a time.

    Cons:

        Requires more setup and a build step compared to other options.

        The ecosystem and mindshare are much smaller than TypeScript's.

    
    Best for: Large codebases that need maximum type safety without switching to TypeScript.
