CAUTION: With CDN, you must define your components as JS objects 'coz browser doesn't understand 
        .vue files. Use CDN 'installation' only for very simple Vue solutions.

            >> For professional solutions, use the local installation:
                /JavaScript/Web-development/frontend/Vue/1-install-and-first-steps/starting-project-using-LOCAL-installation.txt



    1) In your index HTML file, add the CDN script before you call the main script file URL, as well
        as you define which element (with correct ID) Vue must inject/mount your Vue front-end:
                    
        <!-- Index HTML file -->
        <html>
            ...
            <body>
            
                ...

                <!-- Vue app will be mounted here -->
                <div id="app"></div>

                ...

                <!-- Vue CDN -->
                <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
                
                <!-- Main JS file -->
                <script src="./main.js"></script>
            </body>
        </html>


    2) Create the JS file where you will write the Vue logic - main.js:

        Vue.createApp({
            // Here you can set HTML and Vue logic between double "`":
            template: `
                <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
                {{ subtitle }}
            `,
            // Sending to the front-end the entire data you wanna use:
            data() {
                // Always need to return as JS object:
                return {
                    title: 'Hello, world!',
                    subtitle: "I'm using Vue CDN and not a local installation.",
                };
            }
        }).mount('#app');


    3) Back to Index HTML file, make sure you already set the element where Vue must mount its code!
            E.g.    <div id="app"></div>


    4) (INFO ONLY) This same example above but using the LOCAL installation:
        /JavaScript/Web-development/frontend/Vue/vue-knowledge/using-composition-api/z-examples/hello-world/ 


    5) To test and run the Vue using the CDN solution, you'll use:
