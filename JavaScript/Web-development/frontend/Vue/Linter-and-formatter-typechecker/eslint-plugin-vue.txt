VUE > TEMPLATE LINTER: ESLINT PLUGIN VUE

    
    
    ATTENTION!
        It's only add value for Vue projects that uses Single-Files-Components (SFC, .vue files).
        Otherwise, this lint won't do nothing.



    ESLint is a static code analysis tool for JavaScript (and by extension, Vue.js). Its primary
    purpose is to find and fix problems in your code. It doesn't run your code; instead, it scans
    your source files and flags issues based on a set of predefined rules.

    Checks: finds errors and enforces style rules.

    >> Template linting:
        - Vue directive syntax validation (v-if, v-for, etc.);
        - Template expression checking;
        - Component prop validation;
        - Event handler verification;

    >> SFC structure validation:
        - Script setup syntax (if you use it);
        - Component lifecycle and structure;
        - Vue 3 specific patterns and best practices;
