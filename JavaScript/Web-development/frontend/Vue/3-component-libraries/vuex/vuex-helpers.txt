VUEX: HELPERS

    Vuex provides helper functions that make it easier to map store state/getters
    to computed properties:

        E.g
            <script>
                import { mapState, mapGetters } from 'vuex';

                export default {
                    // Computed Properties:
                    computed: {
                        // These helpers create computed properties that connect to Vuex:
                        ...mapState(['user', 'posts']),
                        ...mapGetters(['isAuthenticated', 'userFullName'])
                    }
                }
                ...
