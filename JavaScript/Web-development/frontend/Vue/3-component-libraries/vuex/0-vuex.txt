LIBRARY: VUEX (Deprecated since 2025)

    Vuex (the official solution for Vue 2) is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js apps
    that serves as a centralized store for all the components in an app, with rules ensuring that
    the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.

    IMPORTANT: Vuex was replaced by Pinia in Vue 3.
