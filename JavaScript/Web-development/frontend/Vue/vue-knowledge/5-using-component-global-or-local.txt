VUE.JS COMPONENT: USING IT GLOBAL OR LOCALLY?


    >> Global component:
        It will be loaded before the application be shown on the browser.
        It's perfect for those components always (or almost) running/visible on the app interface.

        E.g.

            //In main.js:
            import { createApp } from 'vue'
            import App from './App.vue'
            import MyComp from './components/MyComp.vue'
            
            const app = createApp(App)

            app.component('MyComp', MyComp)

            app.mount('#app');


    >> Local component:
        It will be loaded after the application be shown on the browser and the parent's component
        is loaded too.

        E.g. with Options-API:

            //App.vue:
            <script>
                import MyComp from './components/MyComp.vue'
                // Register child component:
                components: {
                    MyComp
                },
            </script>
        
        E.g. with Composition-API:

            //App.vue:
            <script setup>
            import MyComp from './components/MyComp.vue'
            </script>
