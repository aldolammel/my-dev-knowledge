VUE.JS COMPONENTS: SLOT


    Slot is the Vue way to send HTML fragments (previously compiled) from the parent-component to
    its child/children.


    >> Slots allow you to create generic, flexible components that can be reused with different
        content while maintaining the same structure and styling.


    >> Parent-components can inject any type of content (text, HTML, other components) into
        child-components without modifying the child's internal structure.


    >> Slot logic workflow:
        ./vue-component-slot.png


    >> You can use interpolation in the HTML fragment that will be sent to the child-component by
        the slot, but the browser will first compile the information and send just the HTML fragment
        already interpretaded:

            E.g. Parent code (using interpolation):
                "Hello {{ something }}"
            
            E.g. Child receives (already compiled):
                "Hello world"
