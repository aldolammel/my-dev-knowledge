COMPUTED PROPERTIES VS METHODS:


    Basically, both do the same, but:

        >> Computed Properties:

            - Better performance because they only are recalculated if their variables
                (dependencies too) are updated;
            - Best for values that depend on reactive data and should cache results.

        >> Methods:
        
            - Each interaction the methods are recalculated;
            - Best for actions or logic that run on user interaction or lifecycle.


    EXAMPLES:
        
        >> Composition API:
            /JavaScript/Web-development/frontend/Vue/vue-knowledge/using-composition-api/_computed.vue
            /JavaScript/Web-development/frontend/Vue/vue-knowledge/using-composition-api/_methods.vue
        
        >> Options API:
            /JavaScript/Web-development/frontend/Vue/vue-knowledge/using-options-api/_option-computed.vue
            /JavaScript/Web-development/frontend/Vue/vue-knowledge/using-options-api/_option-methods.vue
