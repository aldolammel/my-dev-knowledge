VUE.JS: 'PROVIDE' AND 'INJECT'

    provide and inject are a pair of complementary options in Vue.js that enable parent components
    to provide data and child components to inject and access that data. Unlike Vue's props and
    events, which can pass data only 1 level up or down the component tree, provide and inject
    allows providing data and/or functions to deeply nested components. This can be incredibly
    useful when you have deeply nested components that need to share data without passing it
    through a series of intermediate components.

    >> COULD I AVOID PROPS COMPLETELY TO USE JUST PROVIDE?

        You technically can use Provide/Inject instead of Props for most component communication, 
        but it's NOT recommended as a complete replacement. Check this out:
        
            Provide/Inject is perfect to:

                - Theme configuration
                - User authentication state
                - Global app configuration
                - Shared services/utilities


            Why Props shouldn't be completely avoided:

                1. Component Clarity & Predictability

                    // With Props - Clear interface
                    <UserCard :user="userData" :showEmail="true" />

                    // With Provide/Inject - Hidden dependencies
                    <UserCard />  // What data does this need? Unclear.


                2. Reusability

                    Props make components more reusable since their dependencies are explicit. With
                    Provide/Inject, components become tightly coupled to specific providers.


                3. Type Safety & Debugging

                    Props provide better TypeScript support and clearer error messages when data
                    is missing.
