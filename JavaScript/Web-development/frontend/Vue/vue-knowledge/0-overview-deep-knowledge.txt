VUE.JS DEEPER KNOWLEDGE

    >> What is Vue:
        ./_about.txt

    >> Two options for the product's structure with Vue.js: SPA vs MPA:
        ./SPA-vs-MPA.txt

        >> About both strategies, examples of their folder's structures:
            .../Vue/1-install-and-first-steps/backend-python-django.txt    
    
    >> Two main Vue-cores:
        
        1) Declarative Rendering:
            Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.

        2) Reactivity:
            Vue automatically tracks JS state changes and efficiently updates the DOM (Document Object Model) when changes happen.

    
    >> Vue development files (.vue) is splitted in 3 layers:
        
        1) Script: 
            Where the Vue.js methods and other functions stuff is set.
                In a .vue file, it is represented by a <script> tag.

        2) Template:
            Where the user interacts with the web application.
                In a .vue file, it is represented by a <template> tag.

        3) Style:
            Where CSS classes used by Vue.js will be stored.
                In a .vue file, it is represented by a <style> tag.

        >> Convention about layer's order in component/app files:
            
            >> For "Options API" approach:
                1. template;
                2. script;
                3. style.

            >> For "Composition API" approach:
                1. script;
                2. template;
                3. style.
    

    >> Vue logic structure:
        ./1-vue-structure.txt

    
    >> With Vue.js, part of the work is done in JS file, and another part in the HTML file.


    >> To create a Vue.js project, you need a Build-Tool. Here is some options:
        ./1-build-tools.txt


    >> DECLARATIVE RENDERING
        It's the same as 'Template variable' in Django Templates, for example. You can use this only in HTML elements/tags, but never in their attributes (more about it, next).

            E.g. 
                {{ my_template_var }}


        >> DECLARATIVE RENDERING: FOR DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTES
            If you need to use a Directive (more about it, next) in a HTML attribute, you cannot use
            Declarative Rendering {{ }} but ":" as sufix of the attribute name. Like this example:

                >> context:
                    You're using a for-loop that wanna call an image from db. Each product has an 'image' attribute with the string value:
                        "/img/<nameImage.fileType>"

                    <div v-for="p in products">
                        <img src="/img/anyimage.gif">
                    </div>
                
                >> from this:
                    <img src="/img/anyimage.gif">
                
                >> to this:

                    wrong:
                        <img src={{ p.image }}>
                        <img src="{{ p.image }}">

                    right (using v-bind abbreviation ":" before html-tag's attribute):
                        <img :src="p.image">


        >> CONDITIONAL DECLARATIVE RENDERING

            {{ book.isReady ? "I'm ready" : 'NOT READY YET' }}
