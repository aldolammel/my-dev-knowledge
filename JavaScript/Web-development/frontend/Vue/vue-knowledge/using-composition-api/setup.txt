VUE.JS WITH COMPOSITION API APPROACH: SETUP() VS <SCRIPT SETUP>


    <SCRIPT SETUP>
        It's the Composition-API being used with its sintactic sugar, a concise way to code,
        once this way is much more direct and flexible.


    SETUP()
        It's the Composition-API using Options-API structure, but with setup() that replace all
        options sections (data, computed, methods, lifecycle hooks, etc), making to be needed
        the ref() usage, for example.
