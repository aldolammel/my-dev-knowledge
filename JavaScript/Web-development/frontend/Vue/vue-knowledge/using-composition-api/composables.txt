VUE > COMPOSITION API: COMPOSABLES


    They are reusable functions that encapsulate and organize stateful logic using the Composition API.


    >> A composable is essentially a JS function that:
    
        - Leverages Vue's Composition API (reactive state, lifecycle hooks, etc);
        - Encapsulates specific logic or functionality;
        - Can be reused across multiple components;
        - Returns reactive state and/or methods for components to use.
