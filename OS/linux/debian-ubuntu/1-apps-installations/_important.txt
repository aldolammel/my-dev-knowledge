LINUX > DEBIAN: DEB VS SNAP

    Install the DEB package from Mozilla's repository!

    Snap Disadvantages:

        - Slower startup - First launch is significantly slower due to snap confinement
        - File system access issues - Can't easily access files outside home directory
        - Theme integration problems - May not match your system theme perfectly
        - Larger disk space - Each snap includes its own dependencies
        - Updates can't be delayed - Updates automatically when available

    DEB Advantages:

        - Better performance - Faster startup, native integration
        - Full system integration - Proper theme support, easier file access
        - Smaller footprint - Shares system libraries
        - Controllable updates - Updates when YOU run sudo apt upgrade
        - Better for development - Easier to work with local files
