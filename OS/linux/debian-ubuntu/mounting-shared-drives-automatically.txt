DEBIAN/UBUNTU: MOUNTING SHARED DRIVES AUTOMATICALLY


    1. Find your SSD's UUID:
        $ sudo blkid


        E.g. what to extract from there:

            Device: /dev/sdb3
            Label: Ubuntu SSD
            UUID: 6A1A27711A273989
            Type: ntfs
        
        
    2. Create a mount point:
        $ sudo mkdir -p /media/shared-ssd
        
    3. Backup your fstab file:
        $ sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup
        
    4. Edit the fstab file:
        $ sudo nano /etc/fstab

    5. Add this line at the end of the file, and, after that, return to terminal:

        # Shared SSD for dual-boot files
        UUID=6A1A27711A273989 /media/shared-ssd ntfs-3g defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=022,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
        
        # Explanation of the options:
        # UUID=6A1A27711A273989: Your drive's unique identifier
        # /media/shared-ssd: Mount point we created
        # ntfs-3g: Driver for NTFS filesystems
        # uid=1000,gid=1000: Sets ownership to your user (first user created is usually 1000)
        # umask=022: Sets file permissions (read/write for owner, read for others)
        # nofail: Prevents boot errors if drive isn't available
        # x-gvfs-show: Makes it visible in file manager
        
    6. Refresh the fstab loaded by its new version:
        $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        
    7. Test the configuration:
        $ sudo mount -a
        $ ls -la /media/shared-ssd

    8. Set proper permissions (if needed):
        $ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/shared-ssd

    9. After setup, reboot the Ubuntu!
        After reboot, your shared SSD should be automatically available to all applications,
        including your audio player, without needing manual access first. The drive will 
        appear in your file manager and be accessible to all your media applications.
