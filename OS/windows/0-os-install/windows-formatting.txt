OS > WINDOWS: FORMATTING

    PRE) Assuming you already have done basic to format:
        ./before-to-format.txt

    
    1) Reboot the machine and get in your BIOS;
        
    2) Override the boot order to use the bootable device in boot. Then reboot again.

    3) Just follow the installation wizard!

        ABOUT KEY:
            Don't worry about the key. Your Windows key is associated with your Microsoft account and after the installation, Windows will notice about that. So go forward using "I don't have a key" option!
