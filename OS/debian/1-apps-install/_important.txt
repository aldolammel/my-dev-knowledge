LINUX > DEBIAN: DEB VS SNAP


    Snap Disadvantages:

        - Slower startup - First launch is significantly slower due to snap confinement
        - File system access issues - Can't easily access files outside home directory
        - Theme integration problems - May not match your system theme perfectly
        - Larger disk space - Each snap includes its own dependencies
        - Updates can't be delayed - Updates automatically when available

    DEB Advantages:

        - Better performance - Faster startup, native integration
        - Full system integration - Proper theme support, easier file access
        - Smaller footprint - Shares system libraries
        - Controllable updates - Updates when YOU run sudo apt upgrade
        - Better for development - Easier to work with local files

        IMPORTANT:
            When you run "sudo apt install <package>", APT searches through its package index — a db of all available packages from repositories you've already added to your system. This index is created and updated when you run "sudo apt update".
