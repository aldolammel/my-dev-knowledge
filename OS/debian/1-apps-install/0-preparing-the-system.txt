        $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
        $ sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https wget gpg -y


    2) Install flatpak store:
        $ sudo apt install -y flatpak

    3) Research which is the current and best Nvidia driver for your VGA card:

        3.1) Basic: e.g. in Feb/2026 with a RTX3070
            
            $ sudo apt install -y nvidia-driver-590-open

            >> AI prompt:
                "In Ubuntu <version>, I am using a Nvidia GeForce RTX3070 with 3 monitors. How do I check the best current driver for it through the terminal? Also, should I use with kind of Ubuntu session? Xorg or Wayland? Or something else?"

        3.2) Expanding VGA usage with AI (Install CUDA):

            https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/toolkit
