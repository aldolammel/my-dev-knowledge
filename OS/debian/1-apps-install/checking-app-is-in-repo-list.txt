DEBIAN: CHECK THE CURRENT APT-UPDATE REPO LIST


    >> Checking all repos (using old "deb" formats and new "URIs" ones):
        
        $ grep -r -E "^(deb|Types:|URIs:)" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
    
    
    >> Only for a specific app:

        $ grep -r "<app_name>" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

    
    >> If it's there, check if the apt-update is considering that:
        $ sudo apt update | grep -i <app-name>


    >> More details about a repos (which priority, etc):

        $ apt-cache policy
        # Or:
        $ apt-cache policy <app_name>

        IMPORTANT:
            500 = It's just a how high that version of the app will be considered by apt-update when you upgrade the system.
