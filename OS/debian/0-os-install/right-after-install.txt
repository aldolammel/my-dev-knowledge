OS > DEBIAN: RIGHT AFTER INSTALLATION


    1) Turn the "Secure Boot" off:

        /BIOS/secure-boot.txt


    2) Check if all basic motherboard settings is ok for your system:

        /BIOS/basic-modo-settings.txt
            

    3) Keep using "Ubuntu (Xorg) session" in login-screen. "Wayland" keeps too buggy in current LTS (2026/feb).
        
    
    4) First Ubuntu system log-in:
    
        4.1) Preparing the system:
            .../debian/1-apps-install/0-preparing-the-system.txt

        4.2) Display and sound configs;

        4.3) Install your default browser:
            .../debian/1-apps-install/basic-apps/using-apt/browser-firefox.txt

        4.4) (If applicable, for Ubuntu <25)
            Install the new Ubuntu Terminal:
                .../debian/1-apps-install/basic-apps/using-flatpak/terminal-ptyxis.txt

        4.5) (DEPRECATED ONCE I'M USING THE NEW UBUNTU 25+ TERMINAL)
            Customize the Terminal:
                .../debian/1-apps-install/basic-apps/terminal-CLI-oh-my-bash.txt


    5) Making Ubuntu mount shared SSDs automatically:
        .../debian/mounting-shared-drives-automatically.txt

    
    6) Check if IPv6 is working properly:
        Some website hosts don't work through IPv4 preferentially, making a few websites get stuck in loading!

    7) (if applicable)
        In case you are using Dual-boot with Windows, set Windows to use UTC time, equal to Ubuntu, for compatibility with Dual-boot;
        
        >>  Linux works better with UTC instead of Local Time.
