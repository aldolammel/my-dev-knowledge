OS > DEBIAN: FORMATTING

    PRE) Assuming you already have done basic to format:
        ./before-to-format.txt

    
    x) Reboot the machine and get in your BIOS;
        
    x) Override the boot order to use the bootable device in boot. Then reboot again.

    x) When the Ubuntu options is shown, select "Install". 

        IF TERMINAL IS NEEDED:
            In any moment of this install wizard, do Ctrl + Alt + F2.

    x) Case you select the manual installation:
        
        - The "Boot loader" is a super small partition automatically created during the partition table creation (last time you installed the system). In this small partition is where the "dual-boot menu", for example, is located!

        - After select the partition to install Ubuntu, make sure you are using Ext4 format and the root folder is "/" only.
