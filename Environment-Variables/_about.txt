ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

    >> Those variables linked exclusively with the environment where the code is running. 
        It's a safe option to save keys, passwords, tokens and other information that
        must be unique for each environment.


        >> Web-development:
            
            >> For those projects that back-end and front-end have different solutions, each one
                has its own environment. That said, for that cases expect 2 environment files for
                the same project. Each file with its environment variables: sometimes with duplicated vars, sometimes with unique vars.
