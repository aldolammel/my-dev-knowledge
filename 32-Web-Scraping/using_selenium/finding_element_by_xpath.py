USING SELENIUM MODULE: XPATH

XPATH = XPath stands for XML Path Language. It uses a non-XML syntax to provide a flexible way of addressing
(pointing to) different parts of an XML document. It can also be used to test addressed nodes within a document
to determine whether they match a pattern or not.

To find the XPath of an Element, use Chrome's built-in Developer Tools.
1) Right-click the web element in browser and select Inspect.
2) It will launch the Developer tool with highlighted Element's HTML code.
3) Copy Xpath by right-clicking the highlighted HTML.
4) Use the copied Xpath to locate this Element in browser later.
