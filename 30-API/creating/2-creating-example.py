API CREATION:
The logical behind to build up an API is the same logic of to build a website up with Flask.

PLANNING THIS API:

- API goal:
    >> Create an API to consulting, creating, updating and deleting books.
- Where:
    >> Localhost
- Endpoints:
    >> localhost/books/add (POST to add a new book)
    >> localhost/books (GET to return all books)
    >> localhost/books/id (GET to return a specific book)
    >> localhost/books/id (PUT to update a specific book)
    >> localhost/books/id (DELETE to delete a specific book)
- Resources:
    >> Books list.
