POSTGRESQL: STARTING AND STOPING THE SERVICE


    WINDOWS:
        To check the service status:
            Open the Task Manager, go to Service tab. Search for 'postgres'.

        To Start the service:
            # to check the postgres service name, open your Task Manager and, in Services tab, look for 'postgres' and take note:
            $ net start postgresql-x64-16
        
        To Stop the service:
            # to check the postgres service name, open your Task Manager and, in Services tab, look for 'postgres' and take note:
            $ net stop postgresql-x64-16
        
        To prevent postgres to startup with the system:
            1) Open the Task Manager, go to Service tab;
            2) Search for postgresql and click over it and select 'Open Services';
            3) Again, find the postgresql and change its 'startup type' to 'manual';

        To set postgres to startup with the system again:
            Pretty similar the previous step.
