POSTGRESQL: UPDATING


    >> Windows:

        X) First, figure out the number of the Postgres version FOR WINDOWS you want to install:

            >> Test it out of any virtual environment:

                $ psql --version

            >> If the command is not recognized, keep going anyway!


        X) Checks the postgres you got running by Task Manager > Service: postgres

            >> The last number of the postgres service name is the version you got!

        
        X) Stop the postgres!

            >> By Task Manager: right-click over the service, and click on 'Stop'.

            >> By terminal: e.g. $ net stop postgresql-x64-14


        X) Find the postgres folder and open the terminal into 'bin' subfolder:

            E.g.
                G:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin\


        X) Type this long command where you are replacing the current version to the new one:

            E.g.

                $ pg_upgrade -b "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin" -B "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin" -d "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\data" -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\data" -k -u postgres

        
        X) Make sure the postgres main command is available on the Widnows Terminal/PowerShel:

            >> Without any virtual environment activated, test it:

                $ psql --version
            
            >> If not recognized, do it but changing the version and path based on
                your current postgres version:

                    $ $env:PATH += ";G:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin"

            >> Test again!
        
        
        X) Restart the postgres:

            E.g.

                $ net start postgresql-x64-16


        X) Make sure you turn the postgres ON/OFF to start with the system:
