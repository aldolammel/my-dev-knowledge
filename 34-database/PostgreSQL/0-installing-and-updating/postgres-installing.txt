POSTGRESQL: INSTALLATION


    >> Reminder: for updating:

        /34-dababase/PostreSQL/0-installing-and-updating/postgres-updating.txt


    >> For installation:


            1) Check if there's the postgresql in the current machine:

                WINDOWS:
                        
                    X) With no virtual environment activated, type:
                    
                        $ psql --version

                    X) If the command is not recognized, open the Task Manager > Services;

                    X) Look for 'postgres'. If nothing, let's install, skipping the next step;

                    X) If you have it, forget this checklist and let's updating it with another:

                        /34-dababase/PostreSQL/0-installing-and-updating/postgres-updating.txt


                UBUNTU:
                    
                    X) With no virtual environment activated, type:
                    
                        $ psql --version


                MAC:
                    $ xxxx



            2) Check if you must download some installer first: check in https://www.postgresql.org/

                WINDOWS:
                    X) Download the file;
                    X) After the installation, go to start and search by 'pgAdmin';
                    X) xxxxxx
                    X) xxxxxxx
                    X) After the installation, make sure the Windows Terminal and main environment
                        will recognize the Postgres commands:

                            >> Test it:
                                
                                $ psql --version

                            
                            >> If not recognized, do it but changing the version and path based on
                                your current postgres version:

                                    $ $env:PATH += ";G:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin"


                            >> Test it again!
                                

                UBUNTU:
                    1) Execute that config script available on the official webpage;
                    2) Install the module CURL if needed: 
                        $ sudo apt install curl
                    
                    3) Go to https://www.pgadmin.org/
                    4) Execute those lines before the installation of pgAdmin itself;
                    5) Install the pgadmin-desktop ONLY to prevent to user apache to run the web version;
                    6) After that, run your application PGADMIN via your apps list;
                    7) Connect the pgadmin to the postgreSQL now. In pgAdmin app:
                        x.1) Add a new server, clicking in Register;
                        x.2) In General tab, in name set it as 'localhost';
                        x.3) In Connection tab, in host set it as 'localhost';
                        x.4) Dont save anything yet, and go to terminal. Make sure PostgreSQL is running:
                            $ systemctl status postgresql
                            # if not:
                            $ sudo systemctl start postgresql
                        
                        x.5) Let's use the root user (postgres) now: 
                            $ sudo -u postgres psql

                        x.6) Already using the PostgreSQL user, if the Postgres warns you about
                            database version, do it:
                            
                            $ ALTER DATABASE postgres REFRESH COLLATION VERSION;     <--- type that ; too!

                        x.7) Already using the PostgreSQL user, do it:
                            
                            $ ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'myNewPasswordWithQuotes';    <--- type that ; too!
                            $ exit
                        
                        x.8) Again in pgAdmin app, in Connection tab, set the password and ask the app to remember the password;
                        x.9) Save the changes finally! You're connected.
                        
                MAC:
                    X) 



            3) Define if PostgreSQL shouldn't run at the OS starts:
                
                /34-database/PostgreSQL/postgres-starting-and-stoping.txt


            
            4) After to install the desired database, don't forget your environment variables:
                
                /31-Environment-Variables/
