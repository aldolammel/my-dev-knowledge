POSTGRESQL: INSTALLATION

Ask your self if you need to install a database for development. Sometimes all you need is a free cloud as railway.app.

    1) Before to install the database, check if there's the postgresql in the current machine:
        WIN:
            $ xxxx
        LINUX:
            $ xxxx
        MAC:
            $ xxxx

    2) Check if you must download some installer first: check in https://www.postgresql.org/

        WINDOWS
            X) Download the file;
            X) After the installation, go to start and search by 'pgAdmin';
            X) xxxxxx
        LINUX
            X) Execute that config script available on the official webpage;
            X) Install the module CURL if needed: $ sudo apt install curl
            X) Go to https://www.pgadmin.org/
            X) Execute those lines before the installation of pgadmin itself;
            X) Install the pgadmin-desktop ONLY to prevent to user apache to run the web version;
            X) After that, run your application PGADMIN via your apps list;
            X) Connect the pgadmin to the postgreSQL now. In pgAdmin app:
                x) Add a new server, clicking in Register;
                x) In General tab, in name set it as 'localhost';
                X) In Connection tab, in host set it as 'localhost';
                X) Dont save anything yet, and go to terminal and lets use the root user (postgres) now: $ sudo -u postgres psql
                X) $ alter user postgres with password 'myNewPasswordWithQuotes';    <--- type that ; too!
                X) $ quit
                x) Again in pgAdmin app, in Connection tab, set the password and ask the app to remember the password;
                x) Save the changes finally! You're connected.
        MAC
            X) 

    3) Check if the PostgreSQL is running:
        /34-database/PostgreSQL/starting-and-stoping.txt

    
    4) After to install the desired database, don't forget your environment variables:
       /31-Environment-Variables/
