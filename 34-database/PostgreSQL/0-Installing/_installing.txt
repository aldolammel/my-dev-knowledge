POSTGRESQL: INSTALLATION

    >> Ask your self if you need to install a database for development. Sometimes all
        you need is a free cloud as railway.app:

            1) Before to install the database, check if there's the postgresql in the current machine:
                WIN:
                    $ xxxx
                LINUX:
                    $ xxxx
                MAC:
                    $ xxxx

            2) Check if you must download some installer first: check in https://www.postgresql.org/

                WINDOWS
                    X) Download the file;
                    X) After the installation, go to start and search by 'pgAdmin';
                    X) xxxxxx
                LINUX
                    X) Execute that config script available on the official webpage;
                    X) Install the module CURL if needed: 
                        $ sudo apt install curl
                    
                    X) Go to https://www.pgadmin.org/
                    X) Execute those lines before the installation of pgadmin itself;
                    X) Install the pgadmin-desktop ONLY to prevent to user apache to run the web version;
                    X) After that, run your application PGADMIN via your apps list;
                    X) Connect the pgadmin to the postgreSQL now. In pgAdmin app:
                        x) Add a new server, clicking in Register;
                        x) In General tab, in name set it as 'localhost';
                        X) In Connection tab, in host set it as 'localhost';
                        X) Dont save anything yet, and go to terminal. Make sure PostgreSQL is running:
                            $ sudo systemctl status postgresql
                            # if not:
                            $ sudo systemctl start postgresql
                        
                        X) Let's use the root user (postgres) now: 
                            $ sudo -u postgres psql

                        X) Already using the PostgreSQL user, if the Postgres warns you about
                            database version, do it:
                            
                            $ ALTER DATABASE postgres REFRESH COLLATION VERSION;     <--- type that ; too!

                        X) Already using the PostgreSQL user, do it:
                            
                            $ ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'myNewPasswordWithQuotes';    <--- type that ; too!
                            $ exit
                        
                        x) Again in pgAdmin app, in Connection tab, set the password and ask the app to remember the password;
                        x) Save the changes finally! You're connected.
                        
                MAC
                    X) 

            3) Check if the PostgreSQL is running:
                /34-database/PostgreSQL/starting-and-stoping.txt

            
            4) After to install the desired database, don't forget your environment variables:
            /31-Environment-Variables/
