VSCODE: CONFIGURING PROFILES

    Each profile has its preferences in a JSON file that can be accessed via VSCode interface using
    the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P, and then 'Open User Settings'.


    Example of Profile flexibility:
        /Code-editor-ide/vscode/1-install-and-first-steps/2025-vscode-aldo-profiles.png


    >> Tip: make your default profile strong to be automatically used as base for other profiles.


    >> My profile backups:
        /Drive/Hardwares and Softwares/Coding-Tools/IDE-vscode/Profiles/
