IDE: VSCode

    VS Code, or Visual Studio Code, is a free, powerful, and lightweight code editor from Microsoft
    for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It's a versatile tool for software development that supports 
    hundreds of programming languages and is highly customizable through a vast ecosystem of over 
    25,000 extensions. VS Code combines a fast, extensible editor with developer tooling like 
    IntelliSense code completion, debugging, and integrated Git support to create a frictionless 
    development cycle.

    You can customize the whole thing through two main layers:


        >> BY (PROFILE) USER - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

            The first layer of configuration. Here you set the most basic settings for your work,
            splitting them out in two types: what is default for all profiles, and specific other
            profiles.


                PRE) Where to manage profiles:
                    /IDE/vscode/2025-vscode-aldo-profiles.png


                >> Default profile:
                    What is global for all your other profiles.
                    
                    To access: open a new VSCode window and CTRL+SHIF+P and then click over
                                "Open User Settings (JSON)".

                        E.g.
                            /IDE/vscode/examples/default-profile.json


                >> Other profiles:
                    What is need for specific situations (specific extensions, themes, etc),
                    basically bringing the default settings and override them (if needed) with
                    this profile specificities.

                    To access: through VSCode interface, create a new profile and, then, CTRL+SHIF+P
                                and click over "Open User Settings (JSON)".

                        E.g.
                            /IDE/vscode/examples/my-python-django-vue-profile.json


        >> BY (WORKSPACE) PROJECT - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

            Its configuration file is called settings.json that belongs the /.vscode/ folder in
            the project folder. This settings file override other previously settings.

            To access: through VSCode interface, open the project folder, and then go to the
                        .vscode folder inside the project and open the settings.json file.

                        E.g.
                            /IDE/vscode/examples/.vscode/settings.json

            Tip: make this .vscode folder available in your project repository to rule this features
                for all developers involved on the project.
