    GIT:

        It's a version system to control project files version.

        >> Git workflow:

            1. Local > You develop something locally;
            2. Local > Send it to Local Stage area (git add);
            3. Local > Send it to Local Repo (git commit);
            4. Remote > Send it to Remote Repo (git push);
            5. Merge or not the main branch.
