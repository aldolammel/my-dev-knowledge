RE-INSTALL THE GIT IN THE EXISTENT LOCAL PROJECT FOLDER:

    You can reconnect your local project folder to the existing GitHub repository by re-initializing
    Git and adding the remote repository. So execute these 2 steps carefully:



    >> STEP 1: re-installing the GitHub in the local project folder:

        >> 1.1) Initialize a new Git repository:
        
                    # Navigate to your project folder (if not already there)
                    $ cd /path/to/your/project

                    # Initialize a new Git repository
                    $ git init


        >> 1.2) Add the remote repository (this doesn't download/update anything yet):

                    # Add your existing GitHub repository as the remote origin
                    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git

                    # Verify the remote was added correctly
                    $ git remote -v

                    # If your local branch has a differently name, not 'main' instead, rename it.
                    # First, rename your local '<current_name>' branch to 'main':
                    $ git branch -m <current_name> main


        >> Step 1-3: Fetch the repository history:
            
                    # Fetch all branches and history from the remote repository
                    $ git fetch origin

                    # Set up tracking for the main branch (adjust branch name if needed)
                    $ git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main

                        >> Critical: maybe you need to execute one of those STEP 2 options first!





    >> STEP 2: (critical) Downloading the repository files OR updating the local project files:


        >> Step 2 - Option A: If your local files are the most up-to-date:

                        # Add all your current files
                        $ git add .

                        # Commit your current state
                        $ git commit -m "Restore project after .git folder deletion"

                        # Pull the remote changes and merge them:
                        $ git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

                        # Push to the remote repository
                        $ git push origin main


        >> Step 2 - Option B: If you want to sync with the remote repository first:

                        # Reset your local branch to match the remote
                        $ git reset --hard origin/main

                        # This will overwrite your local changes with the remote version


        >> Step 2 - Option C: If you want to merge your local changes with the remote:

                        # Try to merge the remote changes
                        $ git pull origin main

                        # If there are conflicts, resolve them manually, then:
                        $ git add .
                        $ git commit -m "Merge local changes with remote repository"
                        $ git push origin main



>> To Verify Everything Is Working:

    # Check the status
    $ git status

    # View the commit history
    $ git log --oneline

    # Confirm remote connection
    $ git remote -v
