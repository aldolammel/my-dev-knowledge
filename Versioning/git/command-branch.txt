    >> Checking which branch you are:
        
        # check local branch:
            $ git branch

        # check all branches available, including local:
            $ git branch -a


    >> Creating a new local branch:
        
        # creating it:
            $ git branch <new_branch_name>

        # selecting it:
            $ git checkout <new_branch_name>

        >> remider: create it as remote too (using push):
            ./command-push.txt


    >> Force the original branch again:
        
        # Check exactly the branch name you want:
            $ git branch -a
        # Download that:
            $ git reset --hard <branch_name>


    >> Deleting a local branch:

        $ git branch -d <branch-name>


    >> Deleting a remote branch (using push):

        ./command-push.txt
