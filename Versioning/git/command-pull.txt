VERSIONING > GIT: PULL

    Fetches changes from a remote repository and immediately merges them into your current branch.

    If you just wanna fetch:
        ./command-fetch.txt


    >> Fetch for updates in you selected local branch but its remote version, and merges what changed in your local version:
        
        $ git pull

        # Your local branch needs to have an upstream branch set (usually configured when you first push or pull that branch)!
