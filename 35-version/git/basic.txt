        >> It's a version system to control project files version.

        >> Git workflow:

            1. Local > You develop something locally;
            2. Local > Send it to Local Stage area (git add);
            3. Local > Send it to Local Repo (git commit);
            4. Remote > Send it to Remote Repo (git push);
            5. Merge or not the main branch.


        >> Getting in a project

            $ git clone HTTPS_OF_PROJECT .         // that "." makes the clone to be installed exactly in the folder where you are, dont creating the parent folder.
            $ git status                           // everything must be fine.

        
        >> Checking which branch you are
        
            # check local branch:
            $ git branch

            # check all branches available, including local:
            $ git branch -a


        >> Switching to another branch
        
            # If the branch exists locally:
            $ git checkout <branch_name>

            # If the branch exists only remotely:
            $ git checkout -b branch_name origin/branch_name


        >> Creating a new local branch
        
            # creating it:
            $ git branch <new_branch_name>

            # selecting it:
            $ git checkout <new_branch_name>

            >> remider: create it as remote too!


        >> Creating a new remote branch
        
            # After creating it locally and selecting it, do it:
            $ git push --set-upstream origin <new_branch_name>


        >> Checking if you have the last version of the main
        
            # A report with all commits:
            $ git log

            # Find all changes without merging these changes into your current working branch:
            $ git fetch origin
            # OR below, it fetches and merges (or rebases) changes: 
            $ git pull


        >> Force the original branch again
        
            # Check exactly the branch name you want:
            $ git branch -a
            # Download that:
            $ git reset --hard <branch_name>


        >> Sending your new files to the LOCAL STAGE 

            $ xxxxxxxxxx


        >> Put a specific file on Stage (local):
        
            $ git add <file-name>


        >> Stages changes in the current directory and its subdirectories. 
            It stages modifications and new files but does not include deletions:
        
                $ git add .


        >> Stages all changes in the entire working directory, including modifications,
            new files, and deletions. It stages changes in the entire repository:
        
                $ git add --all


        >> Sending your updates to the LOCAL REPO:
        
            $ git commit -a -m "some description"


        >> Taking updates from teammates to the REMOTE same branch:
        
            $ git pull


        >> Publishing your updates (from Local Repo) to the REMOTE same branch:
        
            $ git push


        >> Removing a useless file:
        
            $ git rm <file>
            $ git status                          // only to check what's ready for the stage.
            $ git commit -a -m "removed useless file"
            $ git push


        >> Restore a file to its original content:

            $ git checkout <file>                 // bringing the file content from the origin.
