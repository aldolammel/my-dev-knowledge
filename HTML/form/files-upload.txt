HTML > FORM: UPLOADING FILES

    You need a programming language first:

        PRE) Solution using:

            >> Python:
                /Python/python-knowledge/27-Files-basics/files-upload-options.txt

            >> JavaScript:
                /xxxxxxxxxxxxx

            >> PHP:
                /xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


    In a HTML form:
        
        1) In the form tag, and through action attribute, set the url where the form will perform its service;

            E.g.
                <form action="/my_subapp_done_page/" ...>
                    ...
                </form>

                More about it:
                    /HTML/form/attr-action.txt


        2) Define that as post method;

            E.g.
                <form ... method="post" ...>
                    ...
                </form>

                More about it:
                    /HTML/form/attr-method.txt
        

        3) Set the 'enctype' attribute as 'multipart/form-data' that means you are telling to the browser you're sending one or more files;

            E.g.
                <form ... enctype="multipart/form-data">
                    ...
                </form>

                More about it:
                    /HTML/form/attr-enctype.txt


        4) Now, give a name to the file input that should describe with kind of file the field deals:
        
            E.g.
                <form ...>
                    <inpuy type="file" name="user_image" /> <!-- name helps to find this data -->
                    ...
                    <button>Upload</button>
                </form>


        5) Done. Check if the programming side is ready to test!
