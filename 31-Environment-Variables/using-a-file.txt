ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
Those variables linked exclusively with the environment where the code is running. It's a safe option to save
keys, passwords, tokens and other information that must be unique for each environment.

USING A FILE METHOD:

    1) Install this module in your project:
        $ pip install python-dotenv
    
    2) Create a file called ".env" on the project root:
        Look the example called .env in this wiki folder.
    
    3) In your main python file (in Django is in settings.py) type these lines:

        from dotenv import load_dotenv

        load_dotenv()  # take environment variables from .env. To force this to override the environment variables, use load_dotenv(override=True)

        HOST = os.getenv('HOST')
        PORT = os.getenv('PORT')
        DB_USER = os.getenv('DB_USER')
        DB_PWD = os.getenv('DB_PWD')
        SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')

    4) If Django project, remember to edit other snippets of settings.py, including these environment variables.
    
    5) crucial: make sure your .gitignore file is ignoring this new file;
