ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
Those variables linked exclusively with the environment where the code is running. It's a safe option to save
keys, passwords, tokens and other information that must be unique for each environment.

Through the IDE:
    Important: The process changes according the IDE you're using. This way isn't possible on some IDE's like Jupyter.
    Right click over the file, go to "Modify Run Configuration", and in "Environment variables" edit it.
    After that, call the lines down below, for example, if you're including user and password as env-variables:
        import os
        USER = os.environ["USER"]
        PASSWORD = os.environ["PASSWORD"]



# responsible to call all environment variables:

    import os
    # Calling the secret token from environment variable list:
    PROTECTED_TOKEN = os.environ["TOKEN"]
    # checking:
    print(f"Token loaded on this environment: {PROTECTED_TOKEN}\n")
    # print(f"All environment variables loaded here: {os.environ}")
