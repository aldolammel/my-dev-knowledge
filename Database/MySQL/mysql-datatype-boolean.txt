DATATYPE: BOOLEAN WITH MYSQL

    >> In MySQL, the convention is that zero is considered false, while a non-zero value
        is considered true.

    >> When working with Boolean literals, you can use the constants true and false 
        case-insensitively, which is equivalent to 1 and 0 respectively. For example:
        E.g.
            
            SELECT true, false, TRUE, FALSE, True, False;
