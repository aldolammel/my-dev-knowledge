DATABASE: PACELC DESIGN PRINCIPLE

    It's a design principle for distributed systems that expands on the CAP theorem. It states that in a distributed system, designers must make trade-offs between Partition tolerance and Availability/Consistency during network partitions, but must also make trade-offs between Else (Latency) and Consistency when the system is operating normally. Essentially, PACELC adds the crucial consideration of latency versus consistency in normal, non-partitioned operation to the CAP theorem's focus on partitions.
